!How to add new videos/subtitles to this site!

1. Copy the .srt file into docs>static>srt folder
2. I recommend renaming the file into something concise and without spaces (use underscore '_' instead)

3. In docs>video, duplicate one of the existing folders inside and rename accordingly for your video (keep it short and use dash '-', this will be displayed as the site URL)
4. Open the index.html file inside this new folder, and change
	a) 'title:' title of the video (square brackets [] don't work, so just put a dash after instead. i.e 'OffCamJO1 - ...',
	b) 'description:' correct credit name & link,
	c) 'video:' the name of folder
	Don't change the others

5. In docs>_includes>video, duplicate one of the .html files and rename to the SAME name as the folder name in step 3-4
6. On the youtube video page, click 'share' and copy the characters that come AFTER 'https://youtu.be/' in the popup (double check that the embed option exists in this popup!). In your new .html file, paste this AFTER 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/' on the second line of the file (replace the existing characters in the url)
7. On line 34 of this file ('loadSrt...') change the .srt file name accordingly

8. Open main.html in docs>_layouts
9a. If the video you are adding already has a category on the site, find the category and copy the 3 lines of <li...> ~ </li> and paste it below (or wherever appropriate) the existing links.
9b. If not, copy <h6...>~</h6><ul...>~</ul> and paste it where appropriate. Rename the category heading in <span> ... </span>
10. Change the href="" to the name of your folder in step 3-4, and change the title (this will be the title in the sidebar, so try to keep it short. It can be different from the full title of the video)
