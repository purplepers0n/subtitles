00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,870
I'm into local procurement, so I don't bring much but I buy at the area

185
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,710

- It matches this outfit
- It really matches

198

The staff from the drama handed me this as a prop

199
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,676
And after I told them I've always wanted this, they gave it to me

200
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,843
What do you mean 'you've always wanted it'

I brought something interesting but it's gone somewhere

233
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,565
Didn't this bag use to have a ton of accessories on it?

234

Then, I have one

244
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,565
