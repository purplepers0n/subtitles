1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,060
Oh! It has started

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,880
- Has it started?
- Yep!

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,300
- Well, then. Good morning, everyone!
- Good morning!

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,360
We'll start it

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,380
Asakatsu* JO1! Today it will be by JO1's Kinjo Sukai and
(*T/N: Morning activity)

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,680
Kawashiri Ren!

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
I look forward to work with you

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,360
As the time of everyone staying home continues

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,080
we hope to bring some energy to JAM through this

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,980
So since yesterday the JO1 members change daily to do a live stream

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,400
Isn't it the third day? Yes, I think so

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,950
Yes

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,090
To you who might be exhausted by this self-restrai... self-restraintment

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,960
- Such a difficult word
- Well, it's morning

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,740
We would like to bring some encouragement to everyone who is exhausted by the self-restrainment

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,820
So I will go first!

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,540
Good morning, everyone!

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,240
Thanks for getting up early

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,160
Let's spend a wonderful morning together with me and Sukai and make it a great day!

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,640
Ah, I'm so nervous

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,120
You are Kinjo?
[TN: Kinjo, his family name sounds similar to 'kincho', meaning 'nervous']

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,740
I am nervous

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,860
- Alright, good morning everyone!
- Good morning!

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,980
Hey, you who is rubbing your eyes!

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,380
Have you brushed your teeth already?

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,180
Have you eaten breakfast?

27
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,120
Let's stay healthy and do our best today!

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,330
Did our feelings reach you?

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,000
- Wonder if they did?
- They did~

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,820
I think we can overcome this situation if we try our best a little longer, so everyone let's do our best together!

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,890
Yes

32
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,740
Well~

33
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,430
We got some homework from Ruki and Shosei yesterday

34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,420
- Amazing
- This has such an amazing analogue feeling

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,720
They did their best putting this on the wall

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,980
- What's that?
- Yes

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,540
We gonna do a funny improvisational talk in front of a snow mountain scenery

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,720
And I am the worst at this

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,020
Yeah, I am also not good at that

40
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,600
They wrote it should be funny, so we have no chance

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,980
We gonna suck at this. For sure

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,780
It is not funny but-

43
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,300
In a previous Jamming with JO1 radio broadcast

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,960
There was the task to talk about your oldest memory

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,160
The most past thing you could remember

46
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:03,040
- I talked there about when I fell in a hole at a skiing place
- Eh?

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,340
I was a small child back then

48
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,560
When I noticed it, I was slipping already

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,440
And before I knew it I had fallen into the hole

50
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,420
I was riding a sleigh with my older brother

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,920
But when I see this I can only think of falling into a hole back then

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,420
- What happened to your brother?
- He was under me

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,020
- Oh, under you?
- Yes

54
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,060
So scary

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,860
How about you? Do you have something related to snowy mountains?

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,280
In my case... There is snowboarding

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,960
With a friend- Ah! The father of a friend took me along for this

58
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,780
It was my first time doing this but

59
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,810
I was confident I could do it

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,900
There were 3 routes: Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced

61
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,700
And for some reason I took the Advanced route

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,440
- But it was your first time, right?
- Yes, it was

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,020
Well, he taught me how to do it to some extent but

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,340
In the beginning he taught me how slide from side to side

65
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,520
But there's no exhilaration from that

66
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,360
Because everyone was riding down so fast

67
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,820
And sliding from side to side. I hated how I was going down slowly

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,660
So I thought I'm gonna try it

69
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,920
So I turned my board from sideways to vertical

70
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,180
- ...and slid like this
- Dangerous! That's dangerous

71
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,920
and while I thought wow

72
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,020
The board became stuck somehow and I fell down

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,440
I rolled over twice and broke my wrist in just one day

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,970
- That's what I remember
- That's scary

75
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,940
- We only have memories of getting hurt
- Right!

76
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,660
- These are nowhere close to be funny
- Not funny, but

77
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,320
It's not funny at all. What should we do?

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,320
- Well it is important to be careful at snowy mountains
- Right

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,660
Was our homework OK?

80
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
- It is OK
- Is it okay for you, Shosei and Ruki?

81
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,460
- Could we do it well?
- We sadly couldn't make it funny

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,180
Next up is this segment

83
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,840
JO1's weather talk!

84
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,230
I think today, too, it is cloudy in the area we are living

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,060
- Hmm... It is a bit cloudy
- Yes, a bit

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,760
But when I checked the weather earlier it was stated it might be raining later

87
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,700
- Everyone!
- How about your place?

88
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,060
It is sunny in other regions, right?

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,080
Wait, let me look at the comments

90
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,160
"It is cloudy in Hokkaido"

91
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,600
Ah, it seems cloudy at a lot of places

92
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,850
"It is sunny in Kanagawa"

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,820
"Today will be cloudy"

94
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,860
Yes, today seems to be quite a cloudy day

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,180
- "It's sunny in Osaka"
- Really? That's nice

96
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,760
- It's Osaka, Sukai.
- It's Osaka. I'm glad it's sunny there.
[T/N: Osaka is Sukai's hometown]

97
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,200
- The comments are too fast
- Yes, they are

98
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,900
It is amazing how many are coming

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,420
There are places where it is sunny but overall it is cloudy

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,560
- Seems like it
- It is cloudy at a lot of places

101
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,000
- Also, when we went out earlier, it was a bit chilly
- Indeed

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,110
It has been quite warm lately, but it was chilly earlier

103
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,000
"It is cloudy in Sukai's hometown"

104
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,380
But weren't there comments that it was sunny over there before?

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,820
Sukai's... Shhh! Shhh!

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,660
I guess someone who knows Sukai's hometown is watching

107
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,400
If it is cloudy the laundry won't dry well. Well, mom, I am...

108
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,940
... we don't need to do that?

109
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,820
"Chibesuna, please clear the clouds from JAM's hearts!"

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,430
Is what Naoto-san wrote

111
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,700
- That's what we're going to do?
- How do we do that?

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,180
- It's funny
- We directly start to joke around

113
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,360
And with that should we move to the next segment?

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,380
Let's ignore it and move on

115
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,580
Next up is JO1's fortune telling!

116
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,140
It's fortune telling now

117
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,240
As there are fortune cookies over there

118
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,660
We will open two for us and for JAM, too

119
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,820
- Should we?
- I will do it directly

120
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,600
And we get them... from here

121
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,050
- Then, let's start with Sukai, me, and JAM!
- Got it

122
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,820
I'll start!

123
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,430
- They look good
- Right

124
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,640
- It doesn't matter which one I take?
- Yes

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,800
And I eat this now? Really?

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,730
I have to eat it? For real?

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
Ah, I have to break it first?

128
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,840
Naoto-san really...

129
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, I can't get the paper

130
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,940
I can't take it out

131
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
Ah, there it is!

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,110
Ah, I'm hungry today~

133
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,880
Ta-da!

134
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,200
Eh? Scary! Look at it, everyone

135
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,960
- What's wrong?
- Can you see it?

136
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,810
Can you see it?

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,480
- Letting your guard down for a bit may be fatal
- Eh?!

138
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,100
It is terrible luck
[T/N: The worst possible fortune you can get]

139
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,300
You better avoid snowy mountains

140
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,280
- Right, they seem dangerous
- You can't go there

141
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,700
This is awful

142
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,320
But let me think of it as something positive

143
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,690
It might be terrible luck, it can't be worse than this

144
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm sorry, let's make it something happy

145
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,780
It is really just that I had the terrible luck of pulling this, right?

146
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,660
- It can only get better from now on
- Exactly

147
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,540
- Okay, I will go next!
- Please do so

148
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,620
This one screams that it wants to be picked but I won't do so

149
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,760
So I'll pick this one

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,120
I can take it out without break it apart

151
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,180
- As expected! I'm surprised
- What could be?

152
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,140
- No way
- No way

153
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,340
Eh, no way?

154
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
Can you see it?

155
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,700
Bad luck

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
I got bad luck

157
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,640
- Today ...
- What does it say?

158
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,140
Please be careful not to forget something

159
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,980
Your lucky item is Pokka Lemon
[T/N: It is a drink]

160
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,900
Our luck is a kinda bad

161
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,280
Ah, I didn't read my lucky item!

162
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,390
Your lucky item is a pot handle

163
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,060
A pot handle? Just the handle?

164
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,900
- Ah the fry pan I am using for cooking got a handle you can remove
- Ah, these!

165
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,670
You can remove it

166
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,140
Ah, isn't it that chichiri one?
[T/N: Apparently that's the jingle of the ad]

167
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,500
- Chi- Chichiri... I don't know

168
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,380
- But today, you can only raise from the bottom
- That's right

169
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,160
- Lastly, let's pick one for JAM
- Yes

170
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,320
Sukai, pick it!

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,040
Ah, I'm so sorry everyone. I have the worst luck

172
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,060
Because we are already out of luck

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,560
- I will go with this one
- Okay

174
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm scared!

175
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Okay~

176
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,680
What?!

177
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,000
This is awful, too

178
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,480
Please look at it!

179
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,040
It is future good luck

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,140
I'm so sorry everyone. I cannot apologize enough

181
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,500
So... You might knock your little toe against the corner of a cupboard

182
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,690
Your lucky item is Pompom Purin

183
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,960
Oh~ It is Shosei!

184
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,920
- Shosei!
- Shosei, come here!

185
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,040
Come here! Come right now!

186
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,280
Everyone I am sorry for pulling just future good luck, but it will come

187
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,400
It certainly will come

188
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,740
- Let's think of it positively
- Because it has only started now

189
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,260
Hey, look!

190
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,160
We got these!

191
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,860
- Today gonna be lucky~
- Lucky~

192
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,420
Naoto-san immediately brought us our lucky items

193
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,640
Yes, that's it

194
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,880
Alright, let's put our fortune from today on the wall
- Let's do it!

195
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,020
Ah, yes

196
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,940
Letting your guard down for a bit may be fatal

197
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,450
This...

198
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,980
But I thought so. I might be targeted by someone

199
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,400
- Sukai pulled a future good luck for JAM
- Yes, I did

200
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,400
- 18,000 people are watching right now
- I see

201
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,760
So 18,000 people will have good luck only in the future

202
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm so sorry everyone

203
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,160
I am really sorry

204
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,540
I will put this here

205
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,380
- Me too
- Can you see it?

206
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,010
And the one for JAM

207
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,120
Oh, it seems like there is someone who hit their toe on the corner of a cupboard earlier

208
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,540
Eh? I am so sorry!

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,480
I am truly sorry for this!

210
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,120
I will pat you as an apology later. I am sorry!

211
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,500
- Should we move on?
- Yes, let's move on

212
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,800
- And the next segment is...

213
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,700
JO1's observation diary!

214
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,060
- Eh?
- What is that?

215
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,820
There is a observation diary, so let's check out the observation from the last two days

216
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,060
- Is it this one?
- Yes

217
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,100
Eh? So this is one day?

218
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,800
"Day 1"

219
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,700
"What we noticed: The container was too big, so the water wasn't enough"

220
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,760
- "We named it Kamome"
- Its name is Kamome
[T/N: Kamome = seagull]

221
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,370
"Shion..."

222
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,960
It says Shion drew it. It's by him

223
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,880
Next! 19th of May

224
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,400
- That's yesterday.
- "What we noticed:"

225
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,380
"We evened out the seeds under the aluminum foil"

226
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,640
"By Ohira and Shiroiwa"

227
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,040
Wait a second!

228
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,020
The picture

229
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,460
- Wow!
- It's so bad

230
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,760
Shion did quite well on the first day

231
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,600
- He drew every single one. That's typical of Shion

232
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,900
- Eh?
- Then, Sukai...

233
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,740
Let's take a look on how it looks like today!

234
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,120
How Kamome-chan is doing today

235
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,080
Oh, the water might spill!

236
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,580
- Be careful. Because I have terrible luck today
-Yes

237
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,220
Oh~ It looks great!

238
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,200
Apparently the water wasn't enough yesterday, so Naoto-san filled it up again

239
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,060
- Eh, is that so?
- Thank you very much

240
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,780
Wait, I can't show it

241
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,690
I can't show it, right?

242
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,880
Unless it's titled I can't show it

243
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,980
- That's how it looks like
- Oh~ Be careful

244
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,100
That's how it looks like~

245
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,930
What's going on with it?

246
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,530
- Some... have sprouted already
- Really?

247
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,930
There are some sprouted ones

248
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:26,660
Alright! We will publish our observation from today on our official SNS. So please look forward to this!

249
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,520
Ah, I spilled some water!

250
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,360
-Ah, that's your terrible luck
Yes, there it is

251
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,660
Alright, I will go and change the water~

252
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,020
See you!

253
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,020
- Please take over for now, Ren-kun
- See you~

254
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:47,850
Oh? There are only comments saying "As expected from Naoto-san"

255
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,340
Yes, they have sprouted

256
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,400
I wonder whether it can grow in just one week

257
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,740
What will we do if it takes longer?

258
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,860
I'm getting worried about this

259
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,620
Wow! It says, "I didn't expect anything else from Sukai's terrible luck"

260
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
But from now on, it's only getting better

261
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,800
- Comeback! Sukai has come back!
- Welcome back

262
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,980
I'm back~

263
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,860
They are asking, "Which white socks am I wearing?"

264
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,960
Which ones are those?

265
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,520
Today, they are from Hanes

266
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,040
- Nice
- They are cute

267
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,390
Then, I'll wrap them up in the aluminum foil again

268
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,000
- Okay
- Good night

269
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,020
- Nighty~ Grow big!
- Grow big! I'm counting on you

270
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,000
Do so in a week!

271
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,720
Show us your rapid growth in just one week!

272
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,110
You can do it! I know you can

273
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,860
You just need to work hard, so do your best

274
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,700
We will give you lots of water

275
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,080
Yes~

276
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,720
And with that let's move forward

277
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,500
How about the daily segment next?

278
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,570
Hey, when you heard about it earlier

279
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,400
- You were like, "I don't wanna~ I don't wanna~"
- It's the second 'I don't wanna' today

280
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,620
So, Sukai, what is the daily segment?

281
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,260
The daily segment today is...

282
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
The game of Chibesuna dedicating an "I love you" to JAM!

283
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,110
I don't wanna~

284
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,120
We got our third "I don't wanna" today!

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Yes that's the game for today

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,920
It is a card game in which we come up with a proposal right away and propose to JAM

287
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,240
Well the rules are kinda difficult and I have troubles understanding them so

288
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,130
- Let me read them
- Okay!

289
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,130
The guide...

290
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,960
The guide writes the play time is about 15 to 30 minutes, however

291
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,660
Uh...

292
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,820
I would like to play it. In an easy version

293
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,480
So... Hmm...

294
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,920
There are these flash cards?

295
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:34,040
You combine... These flash cards with these other cards

296
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:42,240
- You combine them to make a proposal
- Alright, alright

297
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,260
So, you take 6 cards?

298
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,120
You pull 6 cards and...

299
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,020
You pull 6 cards of those, too, and then you have 6 + 6 cards, so 12 cards altogether

300
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,180
And then you make a proposal with these 12 cards

301
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,680
- I get it
- I don't wanna~

302
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,300
- I don't wanna~
- I really don't wanna~

303
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,160
-So, I don't wanna...
- I don't wanna

304
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,360
- Should we start?
- Should we?

305
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,500
- So I will...
- Let's draw first!

306
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,980
- Is it okay if I do it first?
- 6 of these and 6 of the other ones

307
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,480
- Do I take one of the another?
- No

308
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
You can do as you want

309
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,860
You can combine the 6 & 6 cards as you feel like

310
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,020
And it seems okay not to use some cards

311
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,400
Ah, then I'm gonna start

312
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,390
So I have 6 cards now

313
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,160
- Do you also have 6 of those?
- Ah, I need them too?

314
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,140
You have 6 + 6 cards

315
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,050
What is this?

316
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,140
Four?

317
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,200
What is the one that says 4?

318
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,220
- It seems like you can use it for anything
- Makes sense

319
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,800
Ah! I finally got the rules!

320
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,620
I think...

321
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,540
- You put them like that?
- You do this

322
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,740
Like this and they'll make a sentence

323
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,840
- I see
- You connect the arrow to make a sentence

324
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,700
And it doesn't matter if you do it like this or like that

325
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,080
Ah, we are doing this for more than 20 minutes already!

326
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,180
I want to have some more fun with everyone

327
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Eh, this is so difficult!

328
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,080
- Ah, some time to arrange...
- Please give us some time for this

329
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,100
Please give that to us!

330
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,580
In the meantime Naoto-san will take over

331
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,100
He is waving his hands like this a lot

332
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,280
You use that word during a propose?
[T/N: The card says "Hole"]

333
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,000
"Hole" is written there

334
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,440
- Hole...
- "When I was digging a hole..."

335
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,770
So difficult~

336
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,260
"When I did that, I met a guy with white hair..."

337
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,260
- Wah, this is crazy
- I don't want to... I don't wanna... I just don't

338
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,080
This is fun, right?

339
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,020
I got the same one twice?

340
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,380
The same card twice? What a waste!

341
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,360
Ah, this is good!

342
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,160
Eh, wait, can we only use the words from the cards?

343
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,520
Only those?

344
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,040
This gonna sound so awkward

345
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,580
- Let's just go with it
- Ah! Intentionally?

346
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,500
Well, it's such a game

347
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,320
Wait a bit, I dunno what to do

348
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,300
Because I never proposed to anyone

349
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,200
Indeed

350
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,040
Wait!

351
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,340
- It's difficult
- It's impossible

352
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Honestly it is

353
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,130
- Wait~
- How should I do this?

354
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
"You..."

355
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,800
- Got one!
- Eh, so fast!

356
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,660
- Wait a minute!
- I, too... Yes I managed to make one

357
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,880
19,000 people are watching us

358
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,660
I will start in the meantime

359
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,540
I want another "You"

360
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,520
"You..."

361
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,140
A comment says, "Proposing is not an easy thing to do"

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,420
That's right

363
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,020
We make a proposal out of this?

364
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Yes

365
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,580
With the meaning, "Let's get married"?

366
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,660
- But there is nothing that feels like "Let's get married"
- Indeed

367
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,600
"Sukai's so fast"

368
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,500
- Yes, I am
- He really is

369
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,730
What? What is it?

370
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,360
Something that whispers love

371
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,460
I don't wanna~

372
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,220
"What did you eat for breakfast?"

373
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,920
I didn't eat anything

374
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,960
But I made a smoothie for myself this morning

375
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,100
I'm gonna drink this

376
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,420
Everyone do you do something like making smoothies in the morning?

377
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,300
Or did you make breakfast?

378
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,020
I... have started this quite recently

379
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,070
I have no idea

380
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,290
My nose is itchy

381
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,620
"Sukai, what are you into lately?"

382
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,140
What I am into lately is...

383
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,200
Well...

384
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,000
It's just for fun, but I'm into making clothes

385
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,400
And writing lyrics. Nothing that special

386
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,320
Ah, there seems a lot people who make smoothies

387
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,420
Please, tell me if you have a recommended recipe

388
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,400
Sukai, buy me another 20 minutes

389
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,640
Yes, I will do that

390
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,600
Eh? Is it really impossible for me?

391
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,680
Ah, yes! Among the ingredients for the smoothie are blueberries

392
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,400
Help!

393
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,020
So fast! There are so many comments

394
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,800
Please make more and more comments

395
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
I will answer everything

396
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,200
Seems like

397
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,180
Some forcefulness in a proposal is okay according to (Naoto) Okawa-san's sign

398
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,220
I think mine is quite forceful

399
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Please forgive me for this

400
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,800
This game is impossible for me

401
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
My eyesight is bad, yes

402
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,440
Ren-kun, you can do it!

403
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,320
Okay, let's try. Let's do it!

404
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,360
Can we start?

405
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,600
Help! This is so bad

406
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,260
Mine isn't connected at all however

407
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,620
So you can't say anything that is not written here?

408
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,260
A little bit is okay? Right?

409
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,100
There is a comment, saying "You said Okawa-san"
(T/N: Until this day, their manager was only known as Naoto, so they accidentally revealed his full name for the first time)

410
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,410
"You said Okawa-san"?

411
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,100
It's okay

412
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
- Let's start!
- Yes!

413
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,700
I don't wanna!

414
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,100
I'm done!

415
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,480
Is it okay to show one by one?

416
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,600
Because you know, showing all at once is impossible

417
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
I will start now!

418
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,380
The first one "From

419
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,060
the bottom of my heart

420
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,060
my love

421
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,680
for you

422
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,080
is boiling

423
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,180
and that's

424
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,900
all I need

425
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,000
in this world"

426
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,880
- And now it's Ren-kun's turn!
- I don't wanna...

427
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,290
My one was quite good, right?

428
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,820
Alright, I'll do it

429
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,700
Is it okay if I cheat a little?

430
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,640
It should be

431
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,280
Okay, here I go

432
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,260
Here I go

433
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,700
"I love you

434
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,360
I will make sure to cherish you

435
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,860
If it is the two of us, we can create a wonderful future together

436
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,260
Don't you think so, too?"

437
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,160
- Amazing, isn't it? That was amazing
- I don't wanna anymore... I don't wanna. I don't... I just don't

438
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,500
- "My love is boiling for you"
- I managed to do that

439
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,960
My love is boiling!

440
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,940
What do you think, everyone?

441
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,500
We would like you to decide

442
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,940
Which one of us was better
- That's right!

443
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,560
Then, we will wait for 15 seconds and you write it in the comments

444
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,620
Please do so

445
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,100
Ah! This one says I left out the "hole" one

446
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,240
It was impossible to use "hole" for this

447
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,440
- What homework should we give for tomorrow?
- The homework for tomorrow is...

448
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,560
What should we give them?

449
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,480
What do you think would be good, everyone?

450
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
- What would be good?
- Are the members for tomorrow still a secret?

451
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,320
Tomorrow is Junki's and Syoya's turn

452
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,290
It will be Junki and Syoya

453
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,900
Because they both can cook well

454
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,840
They could make some food tomorrow

455
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,040
- And bring it to the live stream?
- Let's do that!

456
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,760
- That's mean!
- Let's give them this homework!

457
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,180
So they need to make whatever they want for breakfast and bring it

458
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,810
That's right

459
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,250
So yes, it will be like eating breakfast with everyone together

460
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,650
Everyone, please also prepare breakfast! While eating breakfast together with you, they gonna do tomorrow's episode

461
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,860
So... They are a lot of comments saying "I can't chose", "Both of you" or "Naoto"

462
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
Really!

463
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,300
- "Both"
- Wow, "Naoto" comes up so often

464
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,870
They say "Both of you"

465
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,180
- Everyone is so kind
- Yes, they are

466
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,840
In this case...

467
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,800
- We both win!
- Yeay!

468
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,600
- What matters are the feelings
- Yes!

469
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,600
For proposals and everything else, feelings are what matter

470
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
And with both of us winning, we would like to end today's stream

471
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,260
We will end this now!

472
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,600
With a good final feeling, the time for the end has come

473
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,060
- That's right! It was so short~
- Sukai

474
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,280
- It was your first live stream, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was

475
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,600
How was your first live stream?

476
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,360
It was fun!

477
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,660
I was moved because for the first time in while I felt close to everyone

478
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,760
It was like talking each other through the comments and such, right?

479
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,760
- This is nice, right?
- Yes

480
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,200
Did you enjoy it, dear JAM?

481
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,340
- Did you have fun?
- Did you?

482
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,480
Say "Yes~" in the comments, "Yes~"

483
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,940
For tomorrow, Thursday, like we said earlier

484
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
The ones in charge will be Syoya and...

485
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,560
- Junki
- Junki-chan

486
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,140
- It gonna be Junki-chan
- Junki-chan

487
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,560
And their homework is "Please make breakfast, bring it to the live stream and eat there!"

488
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,720
- Ple-Please eat it here!

489
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,640
Okay, so lastly since everyone is waiting for it

490
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,220
Should we do Conchikita?
(T/N: The Chibesuna version of Kungchikita)

491
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,800
- Conchikita?
- Should we?

492
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
Okay, got it!

493
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,720
The end has come. Thank you for watching today

494
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,780
- Please make sure to check out also tomorrow's Asakatsu!
- Please do so!

495
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,100
Okay... On three?

496
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
1, 2, 3!

497
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,350
Con chi ki ta! Ya!

498
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,440
- Bye bye!
- Bye Bye!

499
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,920
Thank you! You are not allowed to go back sleeping now!

500
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,570
Since you woke up early already!

501
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,820
- I will go back to sleep again
- No, you can't

502
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,670
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!

503
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:43,860
There are a lot of comments saying "Saredo"

504
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,350
- "Saredo pokerface~"
- "Saredo pokeface~"

505
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,560
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you!
