[Previously: JO1 Creative Co. who decided on the project's broad theme]

00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:38,972
[This time, referencing the questionnaire received beforehand from JO1 members,
finally tackling the characters' designs!]

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,643
- While being aware of this representative theme
[Finally, to the individual design making]

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,479
We'll now work on the character making

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,148
Okay

9
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:53,653
- Actually I have requested a questionnaire to be done by JO1 members beforehand
[To understand JO1 members better, a questionnaire to know their characteristics]

10
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,122
You do your job well, as expected of the Unit Chief

11
00:00:56,122 --> 00:01:00,026
While referencing the results of the questionnaire,

12
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,563
Let's make a more concrete character design

13
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,398
- Right
- That's great

14
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,134
Questionnaire...Unit Chief you sure work fast

15
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,236
- No no no
- You're really excellent

16

Thank you very much, Director

- Then, new employee Tsurubo-kun, the data please
- Yes

Thank you

21

I'll take it

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,015
The hierarchical relationship has been clearly laid out

Wait, you're just an intern!
[Still unconvinced, employee Kimata]

This is meritocracy

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,860
I'm not convinced

00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,898
Regarding the dream collab between Sanrio & JO1

30
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,634

Have been entrusted with this questionnaire

34
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,976
Here it is

35
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,546
Oh~

36
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,614
Firstly

37
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,516
JO1's leader, full of character

38
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,318
Envelops the members warmly

39
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,087
A mother-like existence to everyone

40
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,355
What do you think?

41
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,690
Great~ He's handsome~

42
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,392
He's cool

43
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:11,331
His characteristics...he wrote 'airhead' himself so I wonder if he really is an airhead or not

44
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,967
Could he be pretending to be an airhead?
[Airhead pretense suspicion??]

45
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,569
But it's just 10% so it's pretty much 0%
[Yonashiro Director desperately advocating]

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,839
Is that so?

47
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,408
This is interesting
[sensuality 40%]

48
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,943
I'm curious about that

49
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,980
We don't really say 'sensual' about ourselves

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,315
Because this is the result of the questionnaire taken beforehand (?)

51
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,852
Well, he is probably confident in his sensuality

52
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,854
It's easy to understand

53
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,990
For some reason the hashtags are the same as the characteristics

54
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,025
I wonder what's that about

55
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,960
[Place to write hashtags that expresses themselves]
[Sensuality 40%, kindness 30%, manliness 20%, airhead 10%]

56
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,929
Did he get the questionnaire wrong?

57
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,631
Maybe that's where he's an airhead

58
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,670
Shall we move on to the next one?

00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,321

- Savings zero?
- Zero?

72
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,468
I'm curious about how he lives

73
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,004
Though his savings is zero, it writes "I can do it"

74
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,606
[Seems like a positive character]

75
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,174
It's his feelings

76
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,344
But after that it writes "See You"

77
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,884
But with the tongue sticking out, if we can make a cute character that'd be great

78

This guy also wrote "coolness 30%" for himself

86
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,871
He must be quite confident

87

By the way, what's "prince-ness"?

90
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,012
Isn't it 'egg-ness'?

91

Next, we have this member

Here he is, JO1's youngest and beloved Mamehara Issei-san

107
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,181
Reliable and sharp performance

108
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,051

If you look at his face you can see he's adorable

Heave-ho~

116
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,272
His habit is 'heave-ho', does he do it or say it...?

117
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,740
Isn't it a favorite phrase?

118
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,275
Ah, it's a favorite phrase

119
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,278
I'm curious about the 'Offensive Power 50%'

120
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,114
It's this, he inserts this phrase to his attacks

121
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,482
He goes 'Heave-ho~'

122
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,217
I don't like that

123
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,987
[Heave-ho festival]

124
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,988
Is that an attack? (※it's not)

125
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,022
Isn't it a favorite phrase?

126
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:27,760
Right, well maybe a character that expresses childlike-ness would be good for him

127
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,697
But 'feeling of the youngest' and 'cuteness' is just 2% each

128
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,564
2%?

129
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,699
Maybe he's holding back

130
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,101
We don't usually say this about ourselves

131
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,537
Here's the next member

132
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,406
JO1's dance leader, Kawashiri Ren-kun

133
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,942
Wonderful

134
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:47,313
He 'laughs a lot' so his smile is one of his characteristics

135
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,848
I see

136
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,951
He laughs a lot and has a cute face

137
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,821
But his 'cleverness' is 40%, his mind is excellent

138
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,789
- He wrote 'clever' about himself
[He says this but...]

139
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,760
[※Later]
- His cuteness is 70%

140
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,462
Cleverness 40%

141
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,063
Right, and attack is 20%

142
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,064
Defense 15%

143
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,466
Agility 15%

144
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,867
Physical strength 10%

145
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,869
Seems like he's gonna fight

146
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,838
I feel like I've seen such stats lineup before

147
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,673
I wonder if he fights?

148
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,608
He's saying if you bring him along, he'd be useful

149
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,176
But he can't do anything by himself

150
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,348
He can't do anything by himself?

151
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,419
If Mamehara-san brings him along, the compatibility will be perfect

152
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,020
[It might make a good relationship?]

153
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,489
Let's move on to the next one

154
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,991
Next is JO1's beauty-in-charge

155
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,327
Purin-kun's friend, Ohira Shosei-san

156
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,162
Purin-kun's friend

157
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:40,566
Because he's said to be the beauty-in-charge

158
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,869
So his cuteness is 70%!

159
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,970
Wow that's strong

160
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,538
What are these hashtags?
[#angel #passion #love #effort
#healer level MAX #angel level MAX #god level MAX]

161
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,406
He's a healer class!

162
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,373
They're all MAX

163
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,208
If that's the case, write 'cuteness MAX' instead

164
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,011
The character's image comes to mind easily

165
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,980
That's right, his keyword is 'Angel'

166
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,649
We should make use of the kansai-ben, since it's his habit

167
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,185
That's right...kansai-ben

168
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,022
How I imagine it is fluffy floating character

169
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,691
- That's why it's an angel
[Agreement]

170
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,360
- A cute one
[Agreement]

171
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,098
Next is JO1's airheaded boy, sushi-loving Kimata Syoya-san

172
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,733
[Airheaded boy]

173
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,401
His charm is nihility

174
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,002
- Yes (answering for some reason)

175
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,837
His habit is scratching his nose

176
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,671
Scratching his nose

177
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,607
That's right, he's kind of strange

178
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,509
Appetite is 45%

179
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,678

You can tell by looking at this but he's a little strange

He's someone with a big appetite

186

He also loves sleeping

187
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,596

188
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,065
We can lean towards food or towards the rabbit (for the design)

216
