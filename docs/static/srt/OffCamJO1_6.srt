2
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:07,550
Junki: For now, let's go first with Kawashiri

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,503
Ren: This is no good...

4
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,404
Ren: Can i do it like this?
Sukai: I think Rhythm is important here

5
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:13,048
Sho: You can do it however you like
Ren: This is okay as well?

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,038
Ren: Then this will be easy

7
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:16,453
JO1: Whoaaa

8
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:17,208
Ren: Like this

9
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:22,058
Sukai: Ren-kun have a good Rhythm, let's go with it~

10
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,307
Sho: I don't think that has anything to do with this

11
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:25,460
Sukai: It does have an effect
Sho: Is it so?

12
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,777
Sukai: Even in boxing they go with the rhythm

13
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:31,415
Ren: Here I go~

14
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:32,662
Machine: (beep - fail)

15
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,103
Ren: We haven't started yet

16
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:37,411
Junki: It could probably be an error

17
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,927
Ren: It was a 'Shadow' punch
Sukai: 'Shadow' 'Shadow'

18
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,077
Sho: Do a jab
Ren: Then I shall restart

19
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:42,322
Ren: Here I go

20
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:44,269
Sukai: It was a 'shadow'

21
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,907
Sukai: But the score is high

22
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:53,249
Junki: Isn't that amazing

23
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:54,403
Sho: It's 724

24
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:55,997
Sho: Isn't this good~

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,879
Junki: How to do this in one go
It only has 3 digits, so the maximum will only goes up to 999

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,693
Ren: That is true

27
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:05,934
Junki: I don't think I can accept this system

28
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,941
Junki: I don't like the fact that it won't go over 1000

29
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:11,513
Ren: Say that if you can actually reach up to 999
Sukai: That is impossible

30
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:14,067
Junki: I really can't accept this

31
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:16,100
Junki: Here i go~

32
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:24,508
Sukai: It's exactly 500
Junki & Ren: It is

33
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:26,793
Sukai & Sho: This looks nice

34
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:29,016
Junki: It's the effect of the ring

35
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:31,955
Sukai: The ring, the ring
Sho: Then I will take it off

36
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,336
Sho: Here i go~

37
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:37,877
Junki: He is strong!

38
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:39,877
Sho: Oh, and it's the same number
Ren: Whaaatt?!

39
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,450
Sho: It's 849! The same as previous one

40
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:45,278
Ren: Is this for real?

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,002
Junki: Sukai, we'll leave it to you

42
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:52,420
Sukai: If I want to surpass Sho-kun's record, how much should I score?

43
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,285
Sho: You can surpass me just by scoring 923 points, no... I mean above it

44
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:57,000
Ren: Go for 999

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,609
Sho: If it's possible, you should score 924

46
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:59,853
Sukai: I see

47
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,103
Sho: You should do this seriously

48
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,094
Sho: The sound is incredible

49
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:07,807
Sukai: Can I please try this out

50
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,807
Junki: No no no, you can't

51
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:14,534
Sukai: I don't think it's good to be very consious of this

52
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,542
Sho: It won't do if you don't do it naturally

53
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,569
Sukai: Here I go

54
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:22,939
Junki: There it is!

55
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:28,958
Sukai: Damn!
Junki: That is so close!

56
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,958
Junki: But that was so good

57
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:33,488
Junki: It looked like it would have surpass it

58
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:36,361
Ren: Junki....

59
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,428
Sho: Wow, it's 1612

60
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:41,496
Sukai: So for now I ranked 2nd

61
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,358
Sho: By the way, Junki needs...

62
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:45,060
Junki: I should surpass Sho-kun

63
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,682
Sukai: Will you surpass it with this score?

64
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:49,256
Sho: For Junki to surpass me, he needs 1109

65
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,900
Sukai: Will you be able to do that?

66
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
Junki: I can, I can, I can definitely do it

67
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:56,303
Sho: If you are able to score 999, we will let you win

68
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:58,303
Sukai: That is good

69
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,255
Junki: Hold on... I don't think that is right

70
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,805
Sho: The maximum score is 999, so...

71
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:07,047
Ren: If Junki able to score 999 that means the score is over it

72
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,303
Junki: I will do this for real

73
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,652
Ren: Go for it

74
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:14,666
Sho: It will be very cool if you can score it, Junki

75
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,476
Junki: Please let me win if I am able to score 500

76
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,000
Sho: So it's either 999 or 500?

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,810
Ren & Sho: Okay

78
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,126
Sho: So if you are aiming for 500...

79
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:29,172
Junki: That's not it. The thing is, that's my best score if I do it with all my might

80
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:32,392
Sho: Well if you get 500 here...
Junki: I can get the exact score

81
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:33,000
Junki: Here I go~

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,335
Sho: You can score higher

83
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:38,860
Junki: I score a bit higher

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,552
Junki: What's with this score...

85
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:41,850
Sho: It's 813

86
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,327
Junki: What's with this!

87
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:48,361
