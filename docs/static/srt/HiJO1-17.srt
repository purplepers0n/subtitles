[Full of sense! Shosei scatters flowers by the red carpet]

178
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,487
I wonder if it's enough?

179
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,789
- Let's just scatter it for now
- Yeah

180
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:19,599
[After the petals, scattering the balloons around!]

181
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,235
That was close!

182
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,007
This is quite difficult
[Lastly, Ruki decorates the cake]

183
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,342
Do it by your senses

184
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,645
Ah, it's good

185
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,983
It's good

186
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,959

191
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,311
The heart is crazy difficult

192
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,414
Isn't it great!

194
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,416
Is it okay?

It is, it's cute

196
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,921
Umm...

197

[After today's filming, members have gathered in the decorated room again]

204
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,280
Everyone knows why we are here, right?

205
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,948
Yes!

206
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:46,252

23:55!
[5 minutes until Mame turns 20]

211
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,635
5 more minutes

212

[Excitedly waiting while going to call Mame over]

213
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,273
[Nervous]

214
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,475

We did it up till the very end

220
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,766
Look at the camera
[Shy Mame's reaction has broken LOL]

221
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,067
Yes

222
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,570
Mame, what do you think this is?

223
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,105
He can see it a little

224
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,241
Isn't it written there? It writes 'Happy Birthday'

225
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:47,046
Then let's all countdown to Mame's 20th together!

226
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,715
How many more minutes?

227
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,284

1 more minute!

234
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,406
I'm happy, but this is too obvious

235
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,975
It is, isn't it? Sorry, that's our style

236
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:16,776
Too obvious

237
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,011
 Let's pop the crackers together

238

There was not a single person in the dressing room

241
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,053
We were busy preparing

242
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:27,887
We are bad at lying

243
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,222
How is it, it's your final time in your tens

244
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,992
Yes...it's fast

245
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:37,997
It's not often we get to welcome the 20s together with everyone
