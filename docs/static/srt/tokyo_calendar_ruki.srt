1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,250
Shining gourmet food that satisfies people of virtue

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,900
The newest issue of the monthly magazine: Tokyo Calendar
cover: Kawaguchi Haruna
The highly praised magazine now on sale at nation wide bookstores, conbini & online bookstores

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:23,100
JO1
Shiroiwa Ruki

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,700
Q: The shooting is about to start now, but how do you feel about it?
Ruki: There is still that...
*The shooting took place with special attention to the measurements for infection prevention

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,500
Q: The shooting is about to start now, but how do you feel about it?
I hope to start my engine and shoot something good

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,200
Yes, please take care of me today

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,350
Q: What do you think about the shooting for Tokyo Calendar?
Ruki: I was really excited

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,100
Q: What do you think about the shooting for Tokyo Calendar?
Because it is a bit different from other shootings

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,200
in which I wear a jacket or other magazine interviews

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,500
which is a lot of fun

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,800
so again it was a shooting with a different atmosphere than usually

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,150
which made me learn a lot

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
The light is too strong

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,200
which made me a bit teary eyed

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,300
because I have to keep my eyes open the whole time

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,750
my dry eyes become even drier

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,500
Q: What do you think about Kawashiri Ren-san in the April issue?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,750
Ren-kun is also

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,450
when he is with us he is, of course, normally in the position of an older brother

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,250
This is kinda a sexiness

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,750
I haven't seen of him yet

22
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,600
I honestly think

23
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,200
that Ren-kun looks so mature

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
Yes, I was able to see a new side of him

25
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,800
Q: A memorable restaurant for you?
It's not some rule of JO1 but

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,710
there is this restaurant JO1 regularly goes to

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,000
the CEO often takes us there

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,500
after we, for example, have worked really hard at the filming of a MV

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,750
But rather than this being something like my reward

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,950
It became our energy, our vitality

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,000
that we also work hard to go there

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,500
and it's something joyful that there is this restaurant, right?

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Q: Something that evolved as JO1 celebrated their second anniversary?
 Speaking of something that is different

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,500
Q: Something that evolved as JO1 celebrated their second anniversary?
Rather than that pretty much everything is different

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,300
It feels like that everything has improved

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,700
like of course the quality of our performances

37
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,500
or the talk at our second anniversary live stream

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
or the nature of our relationship and so on

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,900
and I think that through discussions with everyone

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,700
everything is going in a good direction now

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,600
Q: Regarding the fan's reactions on SNS
Right... If something becomes a hot topic

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,450
Q: Regarding the fan's reactions on SNS
we do directly hear about it, too

43
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,050
It is our strength but

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,000
The fans who like me too,

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,300
are called JAM

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,500
and after all the fans are one of the important strengths of JO1

47
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,750
and after all we think that we cannot lose to their passion

48
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,800
We were able to meet them for the first time in two years at the lives

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,900
But I hope that the situation comes that

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,100
our opportunities to meet increase more and more

51
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,450
and have a relationship of seeing their smiles directly

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,150
so I really feel grateful for everything they do always

53
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,800
Also, I believe that I can do such wonderful schedules

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,200
like this is truly thanks to everyone

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,550
so thank you very much

56
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,300
Please make sure to check out the magazine

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,450
Q: Your feelings for the members upon doing solo activities?
When doing jobs alone like this

58
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,800
Q: Your feelings for the members upon doing solo activities?
because there were always 10 other people around me for two years

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,500
it felt a little lonely in the beginning

60
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,550
and I was nervous

61
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,100
whether it was alright early on

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
but nowadays I get used to it more and more

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,850
and I feel that I improved

64
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
as the opportunities to have all kinds of solo schedules keep increasing

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,700
and only then I realized for the first time

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,600
how much everyone has helped me

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,800
and how much we helped each other

68
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Hence, the moment when I can feel that I'm glad to be active in a group

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
is when I'm having a schedule alone

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,800
For example, I finally realized by being alone

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,400
that if so-and-so was here, they would say this and that

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,800
so right now I feel once more

73
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,700
gratitude to everyone... yes

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,400
