UAHHHHH

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,382
- It hurts!
- Are you okay?

- It hurts!
- I think you weren't caught on camera LOL

- Are you okay?
[Cool-looking Kinjo's reliable gag]

You were in too much of a hurry

15

I'm sorry...I was too over-enthusiastic

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,896
- Be careful
- I'm sorry

You feel like saying it

41

That's right, it has that cuteness

42
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,627
JOCHUM also has other meanings

00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,363
So we will explain that too

- How is it?
- They've really been brushed up

00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,458
- Amazing, isn't it?
- They're cute

81
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:49,829
The 'CHUM' of 'JOCHUM' also means friends

82
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,969
And it also can mean roommates living in the same room

83
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,636

84
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:01,107
It seems like to fulfill each of their dreams, they are doing a room-share

85
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,742
I see

86
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,814
It seems there's also a key visual for the house that they are doing the room-share at

87
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,182
Kono-san, please

88
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,085
That's right, we received it too

89
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,752
Wow!

90
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,724
Then, I'll like to open the key visual of the house!

91
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,959
Yes please

92
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,334

95

Regarding this, actually...

96
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,147
He's the manager of JOCHUM's house

97
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,083
So he's the manager

98
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,786
That's true, now that you mention it, he looks like one

99
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,190
So they'll get along and live together as friends

100
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,958
Yes

101
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,327
By living in this house, it seems like dreams would come true!

102
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,728
That's true

103
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,765
Since we have the visuals for the house

104
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,168
How about we decide each character's room?

105
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,836
- That's a great idea
[Agreement]

106
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,672
- Each of the 11 characters
- That's right

107
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,906
That's a good idea

108
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:13,613
While capturing the characteristics of the character, we will decide the rooming

109
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,580
That's great

110
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,654
- Yonashiro-kun likes training
[YA-NU-KA-MI's room]

111
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:27,894
The 3rd floor has a training room, so I think up there would be good

112
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,630
For Kono-kun's micoon...

113
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,234
There's a Karaoke & theatre space

114
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,639
So I think he would do really well there

115
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:45,111
- The 2nd floor may suit him well
- The 2nd floor is good

116
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,682
I think the corner room would be nice...he would like it to be quiet

117
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,117
That coming from a mic?

118
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,021
He doesn't like it to be noisy

119
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,823
I recorded that

120
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:02,628
- You recorded that?
- Yes, I just recorded your words

121
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,365
I'm keeping it as evidence

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,771
I'm in charge of Sukai-san

123
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:18,244
According to my information, he's 22 years old...a doublet

124
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:25,618
He often says "22 years old doublet"

125
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:30,923
If I go by this information, room 202 may be good

126
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:35,962
And Sukai-san loves watching movies

127
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,999
Karaoke too, since he's a vocalist

128
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:50,943
I'm a little curious, Syoya-kun & Mamehara-kun's character seems very active

129
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,314
It's as you say. I just thought of it too

130
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:59,519
Kimata-kun's character is a rabbit. And rabbits jump

131
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,688
I'm sure his footsteps would be noisy

132
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,826
Kimata-kun has also been warned that his footsteps are noisy

133
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:12,999
According to Sukai-san, Kimata-san walks from his heel

134
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,135
Right, he walks while stepping firmly on the ground

135
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,105
He was taught by his mother

136
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,543
And according to Sukai-san, there have been many complaints from members

137
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,578
Sukai-san is amazing...

138
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,713
It's all from Sukai-san

139
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:33,152
- Hence, the 1st floor...there's food as well
- That's right, the kitchen is there too

140
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:37,657
I'll go for the room next to the manager

141
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,025
That's great

142
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,894
This is my opinion

143
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,697
- For Mamehara-san's character...
- 103 please!

144
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,201
Oh it seems he has a room he wants

145
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,538
He likes to take walks, so somewhere that he can immediately go out

146
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,575
Then, 103 please

147
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,211
It's also the 1st floor for me

148
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,779
Because he's a dog

149
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,114
Unexpectedly the 1st floor is popular

150
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,418
[With CHULALA moving in, the 1st floor is fully occupied]

151
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,324
Keigo-san's character is a flower, so photosynthesis is important

152
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,394
- So how about the 3rd floor?
- There's plenty of sunshine

153
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,896
No, he's fine with the flower bed

154
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,332
Flower bed?

155
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,800
Yeah, he's fine there

156
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,603
How about 303?

157
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,972
The 3s look like a flower

158
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,107
Wonderful!

159
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,644
But maybe by the outer rooms are better, because there are windows?

160
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,312
Then you'd like a corner room?

161
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,480
No, I'll go with 303

162
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,184
So you're going with 303 after all...

163
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,219
303 please

164
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,522
Moco-chan is an angel

165
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,390
- He can fly
- I see!

166
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,593
He can fly so he can exit by the window

167
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,764
That's true, even from a high floor, he can leave right away

168
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,734
So I was thinking 305 may be good

169
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,671
- But he's an angel, so please protect everyone from the middle
- Should he protect from the middle?

170
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,307
If he can exit from the window, any room is the same, right?

171
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,310
That's true

172
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,480
This kid loves magic

173
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,919
It seems he often does a magic show on the stage

174
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,955
So I think the 2nd floor would be good

175
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:22,194
And I heard from the manager that due to the noise problem, the rent there is cheap too

176
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,635
I think room 205 is good

177
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:37,310
For RURU-chan, I heard that Shiroiwa Ruki-san likes the bath

178
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,581
And if you take a closer look, there is an open-air bath

179
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,985
So I think he would be in the open-air bath for a long time

180
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:50,289
So I think the 3rd floor would be good

181
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,663
What about Kawanishi-san's character?
[Only left with POP-POH]

182
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,366
There are still quite a few rooms available, is there somewhere you like?

183
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,500
There are 3 rooms available

184
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,402
Umm...I'll take 3 rooms

185
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,006
That's a little unfair

186
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,108
POP-POH...POP-POH-chan? POP-POH-kun?

187
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:09,909
POP-POH

188
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,579
The way he says it...

189
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,451
[Full of everyone's expectations, "POP-POH" is...?]

190
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,051
POP-POH

191
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,725
[Without a doubt, becoming JOCHUM'S HOUSE's idol!]
[Everyone in love with POP-POH]

192
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:30,896
They're available, so I'd like to rent them all!

193
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,499
- Sounds good
- Thank you very much!

194
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,169
[With POP-POH moving in, JOCHUM's house is fully occupied]

195
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,243
Before we announce the characters

196
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,179
As a warm up before the present(?)

197
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,481
It's 'presentation'

198
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,485
- As a warm up before the presentation...
- Unit Chief, are you ok?

199
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:57,890
To understand each others' characters better, we'll play a game by team battles

200
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,695
[Profile fill-in-the-blanks game]
Split into 2 teams
- Each team's character's profile has "dream", skill", "trademark phrase" blanked out
- Fill in the blanks of the opposing team with the prepared cards (time limit 5min)

201
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,832
His charm point is "sparkly eyes"...that's nice

202
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,600
His skill is...

203
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,502
Shall we start filling it in from the top?

204
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:16,142
What do you think is YA-NU-KA-MI's trademark phrase?

205
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,277
Isn't it this?

206
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,112
- That's right!
[Nankuru naru!*]
[T/N: Things will work out! In Okinawan dialect]

207
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,915
Mocomoco?

208
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,884
[Mysterious word card -> mocomoco]

209
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,458
Is 'Can sleep anywhere' Mamehara-kun's?

210
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,427
[Full-out -> Kiss]

211
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,764
- Isn't this 'Why?'
- Ahh he seems like he would say that!

212
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,668
- What do you think of this?
[Become a pilot]

213
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,838
For Sukai-san's character

214
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,074
Become a pilot. Oh that fits

215
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,508
I think this is it

216
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,848
The trademark phrase as 'Why?', isn't it wrong?

217
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,753
It's 'Why?'. Or is it wrong? I don't know

218
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,090
I'm curious about the 'Po'

219
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,158
- Whose is this?
[Get onto a cloud]

220
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,661
This is difficult...is it really 'Why?'

221
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,899
It's definitely this

222
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,967
Is this okay?

223
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:22,608
Well then, we have decided...or rather guessed the character's details

224
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,910
So each team will show their guesses

225
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,581
Is everyone ok? We'll start from our team, ready, go!

226
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,759
They're pretty much on the right track, right?

227
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,398
Didn't we do it pretty well?

228
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,869
There's no way POP-POH-chan's skill is 'fighting' right?

229
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,304
- Definitely not
- That seems unlikely

230
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,341
But he's doing a fighting pose

231
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,208
Is it not?

232
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,210
He's doing this

233
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,346
Oh, in a cute way? Not like this?

234
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,485
Our team was like this

235
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,721
Then Ren-kun, please

236
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,224
Then next it's our team. Ready, open!

237
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,263
Ohhh aren't you on the right track?

238
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,833
We've also discussed a lot to decide on this

239
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:28,407
Somehow the name has also been changed

240
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,376
The size (of the blank) doesn't even match (the size of the card)

241
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,344
He has become 'Full-out-kun'

242
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,812
His name has been changed

243
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,781
Isn't this name better?

244
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:39,318
His trademark phrase has become 'space invasion'?

245
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,986
The trademark phrase

246
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,589
I don't think he looks like that type

247
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,928
I think it's a little bit wrong

248
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,095
But isn't it fine?

249
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,498
I think it looks good

250
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,668
Next time, we will check the correct answers

251
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:00,005
Look forward to next time too!

252
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,543
