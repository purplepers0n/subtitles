[New Character Development Project]

4
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:21,488
Last time, each time put together the characteristic cards, right?

5
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,155
Right

6
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:32,999
[The employees who split into 2 teams to fill in the opposing team's profiles]

00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:38,405
This time, using the profiles, we will present them while checking the answers

9
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,841
To better understand the characters

10
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,042
Right

11
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:49,315
By the way, the person who presents the best will be promoted on the spot

12
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,650

14
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,187
- Really?
- Really

15
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,089
- I'll do my best
- Please do your best

16
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,325
Then, the presentation order...

17
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,360
First, Kawashiri-kun

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,327
Understood

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,196
Please

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,966
Then let's check the correct answers right away

21
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,203
This is Kawashiri Ren-san's character, his name is RAIN

22
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,504
RAIN-kun

23
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,575
His dream 'surprising people all over the world', this is correct

24
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,943
This is correct

25
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,879
By the way, why is his name RAIN?

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,749
There's a magic that he's best at

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,920
And that is the magic to make it rain

28
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,690
From that, his name is RAIN-kun

29
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,827
- Ta-da
- Wow

30
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,129
His favorite word is 'Wow!'

31
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,363
'Wow!'

32
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,534
Doing his magic, he's happy to be praised with the word 'wow!'

33
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,571
Continuing on, the one he's together with often is

34
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,839
PiHAi-kun

35
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,342
Kinjo Sukai-san's character, PiHAi-kun

36
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,176
Actually

37
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,545
He is PiHAi-kun's real older brother

38
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,880
Ehh?

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,716
- Is that so??
- There's such a setting..!

40
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,018
I thought they looked similar, and they're siblings

41
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,321
Finally, a word to JAMs

42
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,424
'I'll take you to a world of dreams and emotion!"

43
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,258
Wonderful!

44
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,926
- I see
- That's great

45
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,930
That's wonderful, as a magician, an entertainer

46
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,332
He's the mirror of magicians

47
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:19,139
And now let's look at the concept art prepared by Sanrio-san right away

48
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,210
Cute!

49
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,713
The bird is cute

50
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,314
To think there was a bird inside...!

51
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,983
- Wow
- Thank you very much

52
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,052
That was Kawashiri-san's character RAIN-kun

53
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,054
- Wonderful
- Thank you very much

54
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,991
I want to hurry up and see everyone's concept art!

55
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,130
Next is Shiroiwa Ruki-san's character

56
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,100
He's full of charm

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,268
I'll go through it quickly

58
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,370
First, his name is RURU

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,771
He refers to himself as RURU as well

60
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,375
And the dream card that everyone has chosen is correct!
[Become the king of healing for everyone]

61
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,045
Here, it writes that his skill is 'Kiss'

62
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,680
This is incorrect

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,148
What is it?

64
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,349
The correct answer is

65
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,385
'Can fall sleep anywhere right away'

66
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,086
Ehhh!

67
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,389
And the trademark phrase, it writes 'chu*' here
[T/N: kissing sound]

68
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,125
His trademark phrase is 'chu'?

69
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,993
This is also incorrect

70
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,529
Well it's true that it seems like it'd be correct

71
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,497
But it's 'I'm hungry'

72
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,765
Ehhh!

73
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,534
So it means he's a spoiled prince, is that okay?

74
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,569
Everyone, please treat him well

75
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,704
Then I'll take this off

76
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,474
I'll also go through this quickly

77
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,911
Favorite colour is white, favorite food is dessert

78
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,848
And he also has MY BEST Dessert ranking

79
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,550
#3 - Candied sweet potatoes

80
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,452
Is that so?

81
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,254
#1 - Crepe

82
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,488
That's sweet

83
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,958
And among crepe flavors, he likes ibanacho

84
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,059
What's that?

85
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,527
Ichigo(strawberry)-banana-chocolate crepe

86
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,661
Hehhh~

87
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,996
Ibanacho!

88
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:50,964
Ibaraki-cho(?)

89
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,800
He loves Ibanacho!

90
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,836
And there's a concept art so

91
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,474
It's totally different!

92
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,709
- This
- Cute~

93
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:09,148
I'd be happy if you pay attention to the back of his feet

94
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,918
I want him to sleep and eat a lot

95
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,819
That's all

96
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,854
- Cute!
- Wonderful!

97
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,589
Really cute!

98
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,194
Please treat me well

99
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,963
Then, I'll like to start right away

100
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,667
Are you okay? Your shoulders are a bit...loosen them

101
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,501
I'm sorry

102
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,403
Thank goodness, it's back to normal

103
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,338
Then, I'll like to start right away

104
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,174
His name is POP-POH

105
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,278
Like 'POP-POH-chan'

106
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,281
His dream 'an easy life', this is correct

107
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,784
- Ehhh!
- This is correct?

108
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,419
- 'An easy life' as a dream...
- This is correct

109
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,355
And...small type(?)
[T/N: They are meant to fill the blood type here]

110
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,024
That's true!

111
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,261
Because he's a small type, please call him POP-POH

112
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,030
Because he's a small type, POP-POH

113
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,198
And his skill

114
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,567
'Fighting', this is incorrect

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,502
It's wrong!

116
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,837
Because he wants an easy life

117
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,373
Because his stomach is his charm point

118
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,342
[Curious]

119
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,111
'Sleeping'

120
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,112
His skill is sleeping

121
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,181
And his trademark phrase is 'Po'

122
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,550
I'll go through these

123
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,652
Here I go!

124
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,622
MY BEST Ice Cream
[Strawberry, Chocolate, Mint]

125
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,425
A word to JAMs

126
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,726
Yappo~!

127
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,861
[In love]

128
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,231
His voice is quite low, Yappo

129
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,402
Finally, I'll like to show everyone the concept art

130
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,136
Please!

131
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,374
- So cute!
- He's winking

132
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,309
His special skill, winking

133
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,078
- Wow!
- Cute!

134
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,045
I'm very satisfied!

135
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,047
Wonderful! Thank you very much

136
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,022
I am the new employee, Kimata Syoya, please treat me well

137
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,626
His name is CHIMATA-kun, this is correct

138
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:04,397
His skill 'full-out', this is wrong

139
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,232
- It's wrong
- I wonder whose is this?

140
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,000
His skill is 'playing'

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,437
- It was 'playing'
- That's right

142
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:16,209
His trademark phrase 'I'm hungry'...this is actually wrong

143
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,277
It's wrong? What is it?

144
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,546
Actually, it's 'Why?'

145
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,981
'Why'- ahhh (unexpected!)

146
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,484
And the important part is from here on

147
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,818
Then, I'll open it

148
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,923
Favorite word 'This is a Japanese native' (???)

149
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,792
I don't know what he's saying ;;

150
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,829
If you don't know, no one else would know!

151
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,632
I think Kimata-san was obsessed with this

152
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,734
A word to JAMs...

153
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,538
"Hello, thank you very much. Hm? This is a Japanese native"

154
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,408
So that's what it was

155
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:53,012
"Hello, thank you very much. Hm? This is a Japanese native"

156
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:53,746
Thank you very much

157
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,948
If you were that obsessed with it, then don't forget it

158
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,785
Right, I was really obsessed at that point in time

159
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,119
Shall we go to the concept art?

160
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,422
Then, OPEN!!

161
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,890
This is a Japanese native

162
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:05,825
Cute!

163
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,026
(He's honest)

164
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,127
Too cute!

165
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,030
- This is great
- Too cute

166
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,899
- Wonderful
- That was Kimata Syoya

167
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,341
His name is CHULALA

168
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,578
His dream 'Space invasion' is correct

169
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,946
It's correct

170
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,882
His trademark phrase is...'da na.' at the end of his sentences

171
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,351
- Ehhhh
- We were wrong

172
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,454
Let's continue to this

173
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,956
MY BEST special move

174
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,891
#1 - Laser from octopus

175
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,160
Laser from octopus?

176
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,728
- The (octopus) above?
- This guy

177
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,497
That's someone else's power

178
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,065
- #2 is?
- To stare

179
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:47,934
What do you mean?

180
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,335
Only #1 is very powerful

181
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,272
The one who is often together with him is this parasitic octopus

182
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,441
It's parasitic

183
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,677
Let's see the concept art

184
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,450
Isn't this great?

185
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,985
- Cute
- It's great

186
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,421
The laser from the eyes too, the special move

187
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,424
- He's also saying something, we don't understand though
- He's saying something

188
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,693
That's how it is, thank you very much

189
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,001
Then I, the Director, will present

190
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,305
Firstly, his name is YA-NU-KA-MI

191
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,473
Cool

192
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,808
Do you all know the meaning?

193
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,977
It means the God of the house

194
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,646
Wonderful! You are doing good

195
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,914
- You're good too
- Okay, please move on

196
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,549
I'm the Director, you know?

197
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,617
[I'm sorry]

198
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,353
And his dream is also to become a full-fledged guardian deity

199
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,722
- Wow!
- You're doing the presentation instead!

200
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:48,361
And his charm point is that he's typically inside this cup

201
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,697
And his trademark phrase is 'nankuru naru', this is correct

202
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,867
Let's look into the details

203
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,469
His favorite food is Goya Champuru

204
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,538
He's really pushing the Okinawan agenda!

205
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,273
Goya Champuru

206
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,508
And his MY BEST snacks

207
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,145
#3 - Tannafakuru

208
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,218
Tannafakuru

209
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:12,985
What is that?

210
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,989
Never heard of it

211
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,925
You haven't gotten your throat dry by Tannafakuru?

212
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,626
I don't know!

213
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:24,230
It's a famous Okinawan snack

214
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,332
Tannafakuru

215
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,668
It really gets your throat dry!

216
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,304
I don't understand what you're saying without subtitles!

217
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,139
Tannafakuru

218
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,443
And here's the concept art

219
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,080
He's laughing!

220
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,551
He's protecting the house in this state

221
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,954
That was YA-NU-KA-MI's introduction

222
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,155
Thank you

223
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,395
Then, I'll like to introduce him

224
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,831
His name is not FULL-OUT!!! Are you dumb?

225
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,033
It's not Full-out?

226
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,104
In the first place, there was no blank to fill here

227
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,139
Please don't change it

228
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,475
His name is micoon!

229
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:14,447
- Either (name) is good
- As you can see, he is shaped like a mic

230
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,016
His dream is

231
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,655
Brighten everyone up with his singing!

232
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,424
There hasn't been a single correct answer yet!

233
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,594
His skill is whistling

234
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,430
Next, is shortcoming is

235
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,266
There's a permanent echo on his voice

236
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,901
I don't really like that

237
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,069
It's hard to hear what he's saying

238
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,371
There's always an echo

239
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:43,376
His trademark phrase is not 'space invasion'!

240
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,578
I would hate to hear that being said with an echo

241
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,681
It's wrong! Finally it can come out, here...

242
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,917
- It's 'Full-out'
- Ah, here it is

243
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,653
Continuing, ta-da

244
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,456
His favorite place is the onsen

245
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,358
Is it okay for him to enter the onsen?
[He's a mic, right?]

246
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,659
It's okay

247
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,628
He will only enter alone

248
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,297
Because he would electrocute others!

249
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,567
A word to JAMs - 'Let's sing together.'

250
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,537
With those feelings, that was micoon

251
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,839
Everyone, please love him a lot!

252
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,643
Then, I'll like to move on to the concept art!

253
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,211
Please!

254
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,981
He's jumping!

255
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,449
Cute!

256
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,786
- That was all
- Thank you very much

257
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:37,029
Here is the profile of the character I thought of

258
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,798
His name is Bira

259
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,534
He refers to himself by 'uchi'

260
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,070
It's uchi

261
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,206
His dream 'Make everyone all over the world happy'

262
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,575
That is also right, but the correct answer is...

263
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,578
'To become JO1!'

264
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,147
He looks up to JO1

265
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,483
His skill is not 'chu'(kiss)!

266
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,086
It's not? But he's doing a chu (expression)

267
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,921
Totally wrong

268
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,588
It's 'kiss'

269
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:08,260
IT'S THE SAME!

270
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,962
His hobby is fortune telling

271
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,231
He can do fortune telling with his petals

272
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,600
With the petals? Does he pluck them himself?

273
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,069
He only has 11, they will be all gone

274
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,271
They grow back right away

275
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,974
His trademark phrase is not 'I will protect you'

276
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:22,808
Ehh?

277
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,211
It's close

278
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,046
It's 'chu'

279
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,649
What's the difference?

280
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,351
These two? They're totally different!

281
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,588
The thing he cherishes is his flower petals

282
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,024
But he does flower petal fortune telling though?

283
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,697
He cherishes them, but he does fortune telling for the people he cherishes

284
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,564
I see!

285
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,300
- Like for Keigo-kun
- Yes, he's like that

286
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,669
This is Bira-chan's concept art

287
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,508
He jumping

288
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,878
Thank you very much

289
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,951
Please treat me well

290
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,955
This kid's name is PiHAi
(RAIN's younger brother!)

291
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:16,328
Sukai-san's name is written by the kanji '碧海'

292
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,165
If you read it in Chinese, it's PiHai*
[T/N: It's actually BiHai]

293
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,500
- Really?
- It's really PiHai

294
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,401
Is that so!

295
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,104
Hence, I named him PiHAi-kun

296
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,774
- His dream 'to become a pilot'
- Is this correct?

297
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,144
This is actually...correct

298
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,715
And his strong point is 'sociable'

299
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,052
Even though he looks like this, unexpectedly he's sociable

300
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,422
But his shortcoming...

301
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,624
His shortcoming is 'quiet and poker-faced'

302
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,126
One of the two must be a lie?

303
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,563
Then, let's go deeper

304
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,400
His favorite place is the house!

305
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,502
He's not sociable at all though?

306
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,504
From what we see so far

307
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,574
It's like 'actually, on the inside he's sociable' (?)

308
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,413
A word to JAMs, 'Don't leave Pi alone'

309
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,983
He gets lonely easily

310
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,352
He has this cute side

311
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,522
Then, PiHAi-kun's concept art, 3, 2, 1, ta-da!

312
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,525
Cute!

313
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,793
He's cool

314
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,894
That's all

315
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,129
Thank you very much

316
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,303
I'd like to start now

317
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,205
His name is moco

318
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,174
- His dream 'to sleep'
- Is that right?

319
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,041
Wrong!

320
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,410
It's 'make everyone all over the world happy'

321
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,845
Because he's an angel

322
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,615
His skill 'kiss & magic' is wrong

323
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,650
It's not kiss magic

324
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,051
It's to get onto a cloud

325
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,655
Because he can fly

326
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:53,425
His trademark phrase 'mocomoco mocomoco po'

327
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,059
Wrong!

328
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,662
- It's wrong?!
(Culprit)

329
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,163
It's close

330
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,699
It's just 'mocomoco'

331
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,035
It was close

332
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,470
Let's continue

333
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,441
- This is funny
[moco party]

334
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,410
MY BEST moco

335
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,612
Here is MY BEST moco! #3!

336
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,514
Please start from #3

337
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,415
mocomoco!

338
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:18,751
Well, that's #3

339
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,185
#2 - moco!

340
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,055
[curious about #1]

341
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,256
#1, moco

342
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:24,990
moco

343
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,060
#2 and #1 are the same!

344
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,130
Why is #2 the one with the exclamation mark

345
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,598
That's all

346
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,367
I like moco TT

347
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,038
Next, the concept art please!

348
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,908
Cute!

349
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,811
- He's on a cloud
- He is, holding a heart

350
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,446
He's cute. Thank you very much!

351
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,056
Then, let's have the unit chief!

352
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:57,623
Yes!

353
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,925
Let's raise the energy!

354
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,761
His name is MAMEchi

355
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,897
Because he's called Mame-chan

356
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,231
So MAMEchi

357
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,635
His dream 'to protect everyone's smile' this is correct

358
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,070
Completely correct

359
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,706
His skill 'fighting' is correct

360
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,940
It's correct

361
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,310
And his trademark phrase is not 'da na.' at the end of his sentences

362
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,912
It's not. What is it?

363
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,315
It's 'I(boku) will protect you'

364
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,719
Because he's a hero

365
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,122
Please treat him well. Let's move on

366
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,623
But he refers to himself as 'oira'

367
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,559
Yes...oira..!

368
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,895
So it's 'I(oira) will protect you'

369
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,998
It's written as 'boku' but read as 'oira'!

370
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,366
Ahhh!

371
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,734
The general concept!

372
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,103
A hero who revolutionizes the general concept

373
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,572
As expected of Director, you follow up well

374
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,744
His favorite colour is red, he has red on him too

375
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,212
Food is curry...

376
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,815
Well...he likes delicious food the most!

377
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,324
Everyone likes curry after all

378
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,892
He's like a protagonist

379
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,431
A word to JAMs, 'I(boku) will protect the world & your smiles!!"

380
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,532
You said boku again!

381
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,601
Isn't it 'oira'?

382
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,570
The general concept...

383
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,072
Revolutionize the general concept

384
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,342
General concept hero

385
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,179
With that, here is the concept art!

386
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,451
Cute!

387
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,853
Just before fighting

388
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,355
It's cute, thank you very much

389
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,397
Everyone's presentation has finished

390
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,903
I think we have gotten a better understanding of JOCHUM

391
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,104
How was it?

392
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:57,476
I think we have gathered a bunch of wonderful characters that strike a good balance

393
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,978
Everyone's presentation was good

394
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:06,218
It's difficult to choose one person

395
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,955
But we'd like to decide on the employee to promote

396
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:10,422
Yes

397
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,591
Everyone, please wait a moment

398
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,028
- Everyone was good
[Gathered after the presentation]

399
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,696
- What do you think, Unit Chief?
[Deputy Director|Director|Unit Chief|Section Chief]

400
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,432
Wonderful. I think it's good

401
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,433
How is it?

402
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,969
He'll be the Supervisor

403
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,105
We have decided
[The person who will be promoted is?]

404
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,607
We'll choose this person

405
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,875
We have decided

406
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,714
We have decided on the person who will be promoted here

407
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,318
Director, please announce it

408
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:43,655
The member(?) who will be promoted is

409
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,860
Kawanishi Takumi-kun

410
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,961
Thank you very much!

411
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,129
Congratulations

412
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,298
Thank you very much!

413
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,566
Congratulations

414
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,738
The reason you were selected may already be obvious but

415
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:04,143
Based on our corporate philosophy, always 'smiling', always 'energetic', always 'full-out'

416
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,813
We think you meet all these 3 criteria

417
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,150
Congratulations
[Supervisor Kawanishi Takumi]

418
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,385
- This is great
- He is sharp

419
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,286
Thank you very much!

420
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:20,225
The full picture of all 11 characters have been revealed

421
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:26,064
Next time, for JOCHUM to be known by more people

422
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:31,803
We will like to think of the long-term dream & vision, and the development of goods etc.

423
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:36,408
Look forward to next time as well!

424
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,912
