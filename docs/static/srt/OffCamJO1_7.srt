Takumi: Wouldn't this be the first time that it happen?
Shosei: We're not leaving together all at once

5
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:19,606

6
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:22,020
Takumi: It's 8AM, 9AM, and 10AM

Shosei: Seriously, won't you let the youngest decide first?

9
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:32,015

12
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:37,495
Takumi: I am fine with either

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,801
Junki: We should not do that. I recommend to do Rock-Paper-Scissors

14
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:45,395

15
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:48,546

20
00:00:57,638 --> 00:01:00,536
Shosei: I am seriously scared
Takumi: Then there is possibility that we win and choose 8AM?

21
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:02,924
Takumi: If you do that, you will gain a lot of likability points

22
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:03,890
Takumi: Right?

23
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:04,896

30
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:26,895
Takumi: That is such a new way (of intimidating)

31
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:28,283
Takumi: "You guys will go with Scissors, right?"

32
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:29,626
Takumi: What's with that

33
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:33,267
