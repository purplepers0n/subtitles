00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:09,800
[23rd of March - 11:30AM. "Graduation Day"]
Today, I'm going to pick my graduation diploma at school

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,700
Throughout my three years in high school

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,333
I was able to experience many good things

4
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:23,366
So I feel kind of sad that my high school life is coming to an end

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,533
[11:30AM - The members secretly arrived at Mame-chan's school in advance]
Today is Mame-chan's graduation ceremony!

6
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:30,124
This is awesome. We will do our best to celebrate it

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,966
Congratulations on your high school graduation, Mame

8
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:36,133
"Teacher" is here to celebrate it

9
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,414
What? I can't do it right this time

10
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,300
- I just tied it perfectly for him
- I will do it myself

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,100
I did it right just a moment ago

12
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,333
Please don't record this

13
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,400
I am here to deliver these flowers

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,300
Probably it's too much to receive them all

15
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:57,500
Since we are here to celebrate Mame-chan's graduation which happens once in a lifetime

16
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:02,143
Even though we can only get these flowers for him and some message videos

17
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:06,500
It's a touching one

18
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:12,700
It would be nice if it will make him cry today

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,754
Mame will arrive at 11:58AM

20
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:16,766
- Now it's...
- It's 11:45AM

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,000
The members are all here as a surprise

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,000
So hopefully this will make him happy

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,200
It's almost time

24
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,266
I am getting excited

25
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,133
Excited!

26
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:34,833
According to my calculation, there is a 50% chance of Mame crying

27
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,366
One more minute
He will arrive soon, so everybody please be quiet

28
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:41,933
There he comes

29
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:44,200
He is coming!

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Shhhh

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,300
There he is!

32
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:02,664
MAME!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!

33

34
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:07,866
Congratulations!

35
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:15,900
Congratulations!

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,800
You guys surprised me!

37
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,900
Actually, this is not the only one...

38
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,666
Is there something else?

39
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,633
A surprise!

40
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,800
Yep we got a surprise gift

41
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,316

Wow, there it is

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
This is so nostalgic

46
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,500
This brought back a lot of memories

47

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,200
Mame-chan, Congratulations on your Graduation!

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
They recorded this for you

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,866
He is wearing same t-shirt as yours!

51
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,466
He is my master

52
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:59,300
I don’t have much to say, since we spoke through video call on New Year’s Day

53
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,666
But I hope you will keep on working hard
