Is one enough?

362
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,042
How many can you wear?

363
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,944
I only have one head, so...

364
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,012
Oh, only one

365
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,148
[Before gathering, My Melody & Kuromi Team buy headbands for everyone]

366
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,752
Everyone, good work on the mission!

367
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,223
Did everyone undergo on-site training properly?

368
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,891
Of course

369
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,826
We had fun

370
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,995
It was incredibly enriching

371
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,863
How was it for you?

372
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,597
Deputy Director, please

373
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:55,067
We went on a My Melody Road Drive

374
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:55,935
- Drive?
- (Vroom vroom)

375
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,303
My Melody Road Drive

376
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,039
That's some abrupt steering, are you okay?

377
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,408
We went hard with the drifts

378
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,477
The mission was a little difficult

379
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,214
But without a doubt, we had fun!

380
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,181
Wonderful

381
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,817
- Everyone, since we've finished our training
[Ohira's suggestion!]

382
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,086
I'm thinking everyone must be getting hungry

383
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,890
So I got my friend to prepare food for us

384
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,491
[Yay!]

385
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,559
You're really thoughtful!

386
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,260
That's great

387
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,196
Let's call 'Purin-kun' to get him to come

388
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,364
- Okay!
- Purin-kun

389
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:25,865
Here we go

390
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,565
Okay

391
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,633
Ready...go

392
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,169
Purin-kun~

393
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,006
[Welcome Purin]

394
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,140
I missed you!

395
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,708
Fantastic

396
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,144
Is Purin-kun going to prepare meals for us?

397
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,046
- That's right, Purin-kun prepared it for us!
- (That's right)

398
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,315
Thank you!

399
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,951
Today he's the head chef

400
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,653
Is it all pudding dishes?

401
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,221
All..!?

402
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,324
No no no

403
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,259
He's shaking a little

404
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,226
You can really tell

405
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,961
He was doing this

406
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,463
- Cute
- (I'll guide you!)

407
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,565
It seems like Purin-kun will show us the way

408
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,432
Please~
[Come this way!]

409
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,401
Let's go

410
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,204
Shall we go?

411
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,176
- Wow! - Looks yummy
[These are the dishes Purin-kun prepared for us!]

Amazing! Thank you!

414
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,716
Were all of these prepared by Purin-kun?

415
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:18,384
(That's right!)

416
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,520
- Thank you!
[Happy]

417
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,356
This makes us happy

418
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:28,460
Ah, it seems that Purin-kun has the next order to make...

419
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,629
- So busy!
- Do your best~

420
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,931
Thank you for preparing these for us

421
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,566
Thank you! Bye bye!

422
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,402
- See you
- Do your best for the next order

423
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,503
Bye bye~

424

Cuuute~

426
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:45,878
Let's say our thanks, including our gratefulness towards Purin-kun!

427
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,679
Okay

428
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:52,484
Thank you for the meal!

Yummy!

432
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,261
- Is it the sweet type?
- This is delicious!

433
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,429
It's the sweet type

Delicious curry

435
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,638
As expected of Purin-kun

Yummy!

440
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,090
Then, shall I go for the ramen?
