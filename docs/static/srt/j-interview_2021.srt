Yes

00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:18,230
[First impression: What kind of person are you seen as?]
For Shosei...

4
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:21,717
I think he simply saw me as a rival

5
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:24,926
We were teammates but

6
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,391
Because we met during the audition,

7
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:32,815
Because the first audition trainee we met was each other,

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,740
Though he probably saw me as a comrade or teammate as well,

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,705
I feel that he also saw me as a rival

10
00:00:41,714 --> 00:00:46,816
[The real first impression is?]
I thought he was this rugged and tough guy, his dance as well

11
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:49,107
In terms of his appearance

12
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,609
So when I'm wondering which type he is...

13
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,165
When we practiced together,

14
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:59,300
I realized he was the complete opposite type from his appearance

15
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:01,762
His dancing is nimble and delicate

16
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,875
His singing as well, he has a clean and delicate voice

17
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,873
'It's the complete opposite~' was my first impression

18
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:09,594
What he thought of me...

19
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,267
Honestly...

20
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:15,054
I think he thought 'What's up with this guy..?'

21
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:19,414
I imagine that's what he may have thought of me

22
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:22,389
I think I'm a little strange

23
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:28,097
[The real first impression is?]
Initially, I thought we were around the same age

24
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:32,287
He seemed more masculine than how he is now

25
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:38,417
So now he's, how should I put it

26
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:43,848
He's like a little brother that goes 'Ren-kun, Ren-kun~' affectionately

27
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:47,380
Initially it was like...while being a teammate

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,923
it's properly conveyed that we are also rivals

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,471
In a good way, he was hot-blooded

30
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,600
Well he's also hot-blooded now, but in a good way, he was hot-blooded

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,382
I see

32
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:04,631
I think he probably thought I was scary

33
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:08,819
I did think that a little, initially Keigo-kun was really muscular

34
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,325
So he did give a scary impression, plus he's tall too

35
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,685
But I thought he was really cool, honestly

36
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:18,101

Ahh~ Scary

37
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,762

That this person would pass (the audition)

43
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:37,339
Yes. He was in my sights

44
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,704

65
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,679
I was young at that time

66
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,786
The correct answer is...

67
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,681
That he was cute

00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:29,542
Oh!

69
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,624
From that time, everyone was already calling him 'Mame-chan'

70
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:39,249

So which is it?

74
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,655
Rather than be close, I just normally wanted to talk with Mame-chan

75
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:52,973
When he's on his own, or when performing

76
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:55,442

So it's not thinking 'How do others see me?'

84
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,978
But instead, I talk to others to find out about that

85
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:19,715
Ah, that's right

86
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:23,808
So I didn't think about 'How do others see me?', at that time

87
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:24,913
That's true x2

88
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:28,410
So at that point, we talk to each other

89
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,581

90
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,189

- It started from there so

I'll start

360
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:34,278
'UUUUUNNNNNNN'

361
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,268
In brackets, 'UUUUUNNNNNNN'

362
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:40,279
- In brackets?
- Yeah

363
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,330
- Do you have a reason?
- Because you always say it

364
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,294
Because I always say it

365
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,391
That's what Shion is made of

366
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:47,034
- Thank you
- Yeah

367
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,090
 'In my past life, I was god...'

368
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,579
'Blah blah...'

369
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,478
'In my past life, I was god, blah blah...'

370
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:53,348
It starts with that

371
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,223
- Like a story, yeah?
- Yes

372
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,706
[Finally, strike a pose]

373
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,803
Hands and legs, the opposite

374
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:04,386
'God is in the details'

375
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,513
I got it correct, right?

376
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:06,013
Yeah x3

377
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:09,502
I think this these words are amazing and suit Ren-kun

378
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:13,671
He gets everything done, up to the finest details

379
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:17,473
How should I say it...I think it suits Ren-kun, so I chose it

380
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:20,682
'Overcoming'

381
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:26,348
After becoming JO1, he has talked to me about various worries

382
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:34,271
He worries, but overcomes it. I often see that sight

383
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:38,238
So Shosei's first page is 'Overcoming'

384
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:39,955
[Finally, strike a pose]

385
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,434
'I am Keigo'

386
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:47,483
With that...rather than a book...

387
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:48,272
It's a picture book!

388
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,144
It's a picture book that little kids would read

389
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:55,855
What would Takumi's be...

390
00:13:57,161 --> 00:14:00,000
'10 promises to fulfil my dream'

391
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:02,597
[Satisfied]
It's great!

392
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,624
- It kinda fits?
- It fits

393
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:05,978
On the cover, Takumi is like this

394
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,342
Isn't that a little lame?

395
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:12,101
That kind of picture book.
A picture book Ichirou-san would publish

396
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,869
- Like those that benefit readers
- Right x5

397
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,223
[Finally, strike a pose]

398
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,375
Ohhhh cool

399
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:22,849
'There's only 1 important thing in life:'

400
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:23,890
'Muscles'

401
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,123
'Me, and the rest'

402
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:29,507
That is someone else's words

403
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:31,959
But something like that

404
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,379
Ah, that type

405
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,189
That type

406
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,796
Like there's only Ruki and not-Ruki

407
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:36,628
Ah I see

408
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,587
It's split properly

409
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,776
[The 2 obsessed over the chemistry test strike a pose]

410
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:44,925
If you were to give a present,
would you make it a surprise, or ask the other party

411
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,552
This is easy

412
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:50,128
Will this be an easy one?

413
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,783
It seems like the decision will split

414
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:53,758
Ready, go!

415
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:54,931
Both: Surprise!

416
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:58,200
Okay, I'll write

417
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,523
"Friends. Hard work'

418
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:01,624
That's great

419
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:02,756
For this guy

420
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:08,711
'Always putting all my effort, always earnest...'

421
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:09,851
'Live that way'

422
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,961
Isn't that for you?

423
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,678
'Live that way'

424
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:16,313
- Junki-kun added himself in
- 'I live that way'

425
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:17,482
Junki-kun's mark is added in

426
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:18,280
'I live that way'

427
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,069
That's great

428
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:20,545
[Finally, strike a pose]

429
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:24,236
This is embarrassing
