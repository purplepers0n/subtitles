00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,002
They're seriously cute

186
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,540
It burst!

187
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,376
Selfie

188
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,382
- He's playing guitar
- It's YA-NU-KA-MI

189
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,483
He's playing guitar

190
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,284
Guitar is cool!

191
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,597
Cute

192
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,498
He's floating?!

193
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,400
Shosei is flying

194
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,001

POP-POH-chan

197
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,580
POP-POH's eyes were sparkly

198
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,549
The paper flew to him like

199
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,284
It was so cute

200
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:09,455
Each character had different items, like the guitar

201
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,457
Junki's had a soccer ball

202
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,492
He was kicking the soccer ball

203
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,861
- Mame-chan's with the net
- He was holding a net

204
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,962
Wow

205
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,762
MAMEchi~

206
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,831
Shosei(moco) was flying!

207
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,433
He was flying just now

208
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,100
As expected of an angel

209
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,834
Amazing

210
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,568
Too cute

211
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:29,108
Developing them together with Sanrio-san, such cute characters of JOCHUM were born

212
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,410
Thank you very much

213
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,381
On top of that, we were able to see such a wonderful animation

214
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,885
Sanrio-san, thank you very much

215
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:45,324
From now on, not just JO1, but JOCHUM will be by JAMs side

216
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,360
And they can feel closer to them

217
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Yes

218
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,965
That's right, and not just JAM, we hope they will be loved by many people

219
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,636
Surely they will become characters that are loved by people all over the world!

220
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,039
Because CHULALA is around, they will be popular in outer space too

221
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,343
Let's aim for outer space

222
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:09,982
And from today, this project's Twitter & Instagram official account

223
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,853

224
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:23,396
