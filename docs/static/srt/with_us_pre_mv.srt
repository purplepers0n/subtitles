135
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:10,033

136
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:10,966
Right

137
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:14,333

Keigo: This time, I'm the protagonist

162
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,299
Huh?

163
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:07,266
Syoya: First time I've heard this

164
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:07,833
Shion: Possible

165
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,399

166
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,433

167
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,299
Keigo: There's no such thing

168
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:16,799

175
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,466
Sho: The echo was a little

176
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,500
Keigo: Ours was more interesting, right?

177
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,833
Keigo: Let's ask, which was more interesting?

178
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:41,000
Junki: Between IG & TikTok, which was more interesting

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,133
Sho: For ours, due to the echo our voices were kinda
Junki: That's right

180
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,799
Ren: But we did ours at the same location

181
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,666
Keigo: They sure are making excuses

182
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,399
Sho: Was it so hyped?
Keigo: Ours was really hyped, right?

183
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,333
Sho: Everyone, please comment which was more hyped up

184
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,600
Keigo: For those that watched neither, they can just enjoy here

185
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,899
Sho: That's right

186
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,033
Junki: They said Instagram

187
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,200
Ren: Wow. I only saw one Instagram

188
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,833
Junki: There's more TikTok

189
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,566
Shosei: It says TikTok

190
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,100
Keigo: There's more TikTok after all

191
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,833
Junki: There's quite a lot of TikTok

192
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,399
Shion: Hang on, there's only TikTok

193
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,899
Keigo: But if you mix us, like water & oil, we'll match

194
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,866
Water & oil don't mix

195
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:29,266
Junki: No no, especially those 2 you can't

196
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:35,799
Sho: We'll pass the camera around

197
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,100
Sho: Be careful of this

198
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,333
Sho: Should we put the drinks below?

199
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,399
That's dangerous

200
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,966
It'll spill

201
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,466
Sho: 2nd Album 'With Us'...

202
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:52,833
Sho: Everyone look there

203
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,933
Keigo: Let's say something about 'With Us'

204
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:57,533
Sho: About 'With Us' or 2nd album songs

205
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:00,233
Junki: I'm happy we get to release our 2nd album

206
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,200
That's right

207
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
Keigo: How is it, Mame?

208
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,733
Mame: Yes!

209
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,666
Keigo: Anything about the 2nd album?

210
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,966
Mame: 2nd album?

211
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:08,799
Keigo: Songs that you like etc.

212
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,433
Mame: Ehhh.....it's that...umm.....

213
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:15,399
Mame: 'Walk It Like (I) Talk It'

214
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,633
That was dangerous

215
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:19,866
Mame: Is it correct?

216
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,399
It's correct

217
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,466
Sho: That song is nice isn't it?

218
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,333
Mame: It is

219
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,200
What do you like about it?

220
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,933
Mame: The dance!

221
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:27,733
Keigo: Oh that's great

222
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:28,866
Shion: Oh the dance is epic

223
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,799
Keigo: It's real hyped

224
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,899
Keigo: I bet if we perform it at a live, it'll be so hyped up

225
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,566
Sho: Please look forward to it

226
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:38,366
Sho: And Junki, is there a song you have in mind?

227
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,299
Junki: Eh?

228
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:41,899
Junki: What is it?

229
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,066
'What is it?'

230
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:44,933
Sho: It's this, right?

231
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:46,566
Junki: 'Touch'?

232
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:49,000
Ren: 'Touch?'

233
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,533
Keigo: What memories do you have about 'Touch'?

234
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,733
Junki: We can't talk about 'Touch' yet, so

235
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:56,533
Keigo: So we can't "touch" on it yet?

236
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,166
Junki: I would like to keep it that way

237
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,166
Junki: Wait I'm getting red

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,899
Junki: This is Sho-kun's fault

239
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,200
Shosei: It's a good song, right?

240
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,433
It's a good song

241
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,799
Keigo: What about Sukai?

242
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,433
Sukai: Yes

243
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,100
Keigo: Is there a song you like?

244
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,333
Sukai: A song I like?

245
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:17,966
Sukai: 'Ryuuseiu' (Meteor Shower)

246
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:19,466
Ahh 'Ryuuseiu'!

247
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,166
I get it! It's a great song

248
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,433
Keigo: Which part?

249
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,666
Sukai: Which part?

250
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,366
Sukai: The lyrics are...

251
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,866
Shion: The words he doesn't say, I will translate

252
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,033
Ren: Ah, you'll translate?

253
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:35,933
Shion: Go ahead

254
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,533
Shion: 'Those who are not watching now'

255
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,766
Shion: 'You know that you're dumb right?'

256
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,200
Scary!

257
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,566
That's not an explanation

258
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,566
Sukai: But really, the lyrics are great

259
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:46,333
The lyrics are great

260
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,700
Sukai: 'It would be great if your wish and mine could cross paths'

261
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,899
AH~

262
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,000
Sukai: That kind of image

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,466
Ren: Your 'AH~' is too loud

264
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,466
Junki: AH~

265
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,666
Junki: Ren-kun what about you?

266
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,533
Ren: My favorite is...

267
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:02,766
Ren: 'ZERO'

268
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,466
AHHH~

269
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:05,200
Ren: Your 'AH' is loud

270
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,433
Keigo: You mean you have NO favorite?

271
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,000
Ren: Huh? Well, let's just say it's so

272
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,166
Junki: it's a song called 'ZERO'

273
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,866
Keigo: We have a song called 'ZERO'

274
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,166
Keigo: What do you like about it?

275
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:17,666
Ren: Who are you asking?

276
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,433
Keigo: Ren-kun

277
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,066
Ren: Ah, me

278
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,099
Ren: The lyrics are beautiful

279
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:22,700
Shion: You're so right

280
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,900
Ren: I think it's best conveyed listening to the song while following the lyrics

281
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,333
Sho: For the 2nd album, we want them to pay attention to the lyrics

282
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:37,933
Sho: Pay attention to it and let us know what you think

283
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,566
Keigo: Lots of emotions were put in

284
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:44,400
Sho: The 11 of us put in our emotions to sing

285
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,900
Sho: Let's read the comments too

286
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,633
Okay

287
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:49,666
Keigo: Rukkun, read the comments

288
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,833
Ruki: Shion will read it

289
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,733
Shion: The comments are seriously fast

290
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,200
Keigo: Whatever you manage to see

291
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,566
Shion: Whatever I manage to see

292
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,566
Ruki: Oh, random

293
00:17:58,566 --> 00:17:59,500
Shion: 'Junki~'

294
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,966
Junki: That...thank you it's Junki

295
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,200
Shion: 'Ruki-kun are you drinking coffee?'

296
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,033
Ruki: This is cola
Sho: It's cola

297
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,166
Shosei: Can you drink coffee?

298
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:15,733
Ruki: Recently I can. The one Sho-kun recommended

299
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,633
Sho: For the first time, during practice

300
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:22,166
Sho: He said he was sleepy so I made him drink coffee...not *made* him but...

301
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,000
Ruki: *made* me drink lol

302
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,433
Sho: He can't drink it black
Ruki: Right

303
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:28,033
Sho: But the coffee I make is the only one he can drink

304
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:28,733
Sho: Black

305
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,866
Shosei: It's good
All: Really?

306
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:30,900
Sho: Shosei drank it too, right?

307
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,299
Keigo: Is there something different about this black coffee?

308
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,000
Sho: Yes
Syoya: That...right?

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,533
Sho: The taste right?
Syoya: That is yummy

310
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,866
Sho: I have one that's a little fruity

311
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,933
Sho: I made him drink it

312
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,333
Sho: Saying I *made* him drink it is a little...

313
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,700
Made him drink it?

314
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,966
Syoya: He blessed it

315
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:45,766
Sho: What is it...

316
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:47,733
Keigo: You recommended it, right?
Sho: Right, I recommended it

317
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,966
Sho: After I recommended it, he drank it

318
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:53,500
Sho: He gulped it down

319
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,733
Sho: Yeah...

320
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,566
Sho: I was happy

321
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,000
Shosei: It's delicious

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,833
Ruki: It means Sho-kun is good at making coffee
Sho: That's what it means. Wonderful

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,466
Sukai: Ah! There's a comment

324
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,000
Sho: Yes

325
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,299
Sukai: Umm...it's a good one

326
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,466
Sukai: Shosei, do a funny face

327
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,966
Shion:  Uwah!! That's a good one!

328
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,000
Sho: We only saw it from afar

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,333
Sukai: Ah! I found a comment

330
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,233
Sukai: Shosei, do a funny face~

331
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,000
Shion: Shosei, it's great

332
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,799
Sukai: It's great

333
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,533
Shion: Really great

334
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:29,700
Sukai: Today is going well

335
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,299
Shosei: I feel like I'm gonna lose various things

336
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,700
Shosei: I feel like I'm gonna lose various things
Shion: Various things?

337
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,000
Keigo: You will lose Golden Week

338
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,533
Shion: You just lost half of the member's LINE

339
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,666
Shosei: That would be the toughest

340
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,266
Sho: You did well

341
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,166
Junki: 'I'm watching from Huis Ten Bosch'

342
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:51,933
Wow!

343
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:52,733
Keigo: Really?

344
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,799
Junki: Where is Huis Ten Bosch?

345
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,466
Sho: Ehh??

346
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,466
Syoya: It's like a resort
Keigo: If you don't know, don't say it

347
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:57,366
Ren: In Nagasaki
Sho: Nagasaki

348
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:59,299
Junki: I thought it sounded like somewhere amazing

349
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,766
Keigo: You didn't know?
Takumi: 'Thought it sounded amazing...'

350
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,566
Shion: That's embarrassing

351
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,933
Sho: I thought you knew!
Keigo: You didn't know??

352
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:06,433
Junki: It sounded amazing
Takumi: 'Sounded amazing...'

353
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,700
Sho: It seemed like you knew it

354
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,833
Sho: Are you watching from Huis Ten Bosch?

355
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
Junki: Huis Ten Bosch is amazing

356
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,066
Keigo: Do you really not know?

357
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,266
Junki: Nagasaki Huis Ten Bosch?
[*It's a theme park]

358
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,433
Shosei: It says 'I'm Dubai JAM!'

359
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:21,166
Shosei: Thank you for watching from far away!
Keigo: Thank you!

360
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,266
Sho: Thank you!

361
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,666
Sho: Watching all the way from Huis Ten Bosch

362
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,166
Keigo: Enough of where you're watching from, we already did that

363
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,033
Ren: Wow, it says 'Shosei you've worked hard', 'Shosei you're cute!'

364
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,500
Shion: There's lots of 'Shosei's the best'

365
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,033
Shosei: So kind!

366
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,400
Ren: It says 'Shosei is the cutest in the world'

367
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,799
Ren: But no one said you were funny

368
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,799
Shosei: You didn't have to mention that

369
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,566
Sho: He made quite a deep wound

370
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:50,166
Shosei: They followed up perfectly for me but I got attacked here

371
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,733
Keigo: What did everyone do for Golden Week?

372
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,000
Shosei: Oh! I wanna know

373
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,333
Junki: It's also what they are doing/going right now, right?

374
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,599
Sho: By the way, does anyone know what day it is today?

375
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,633
Junki: We know it, don't we?

376
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,866
Sho: Those who answered earlier, don't say it

377
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:08,200
Sho: Do you know what day it is? Keigo

378
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:12,866
Keigo: Greenery!

379
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:14,133
Junki: Ahh it's close

380
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,166
Ren: Does Shosei know?
Sho: Shosei knows it?

381
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,900
Shosei: Ohira Shosei Day

382
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,333
Shion: Oh no

383
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,833
Shion: Now you probably lost your family too

384
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,099
Junki: Hey! Dummy!
Shion: I mean their LINE

385
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,033
Shion: He lost his family's LINE

386
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:31,233
Junki: Family's LINE

387
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,333
Shion: He lost it

388
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,466
Shosei: Plus I lost 100 fans

389
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,299
Keigo: Then Takumi may know the actual day

390
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,333
Takumi: I really do
Sho: He answered it earlier

391
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,666
Keigo: Ah he did
Sho: Right

392
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,766
Sho: Mame do you know it?
Keigo: Mame what day is it?

393
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,566
Mame: Children's Day

394
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,166
Keigo: Ah it's not

395
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,133
It's close~

396
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,666
Takumi: Plus I guessed it right
Syoya: Yeah Takumi-kun did

397
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,366
Sho: Does Ruki know?

398
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:48,233
Ruki: Health(Kenkō) Memorial Day

399
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,066
Sho: Yes, correct

400
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,066
Ruki: OH REALLY?

401
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:50,900
Ruki: I DID IT!

402
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,566
Takumi: Eh? It's wrong
Ren: It's a little different

403
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,933
Ruki: ?! Ah? He scored me kindly. Thank you

404
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,633
It's Constitution(kenpō) Memorial Day

405
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,933
Ruki: Ah, Constitution Memorial Day

406
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,099
Sho: Well, it was pretty much correct

407
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,666
Takumi: 'Pretty much correct'?!? It was completely wrong

408
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,933
Sho: Because of the coffee thing

409
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,099
Ruki: I was the most shocked. Getting it right from randomly saying something

410
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:13,166
Keigo: By the way, do you know what day it is tomorrow?

411
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,433
Ren: Tomorrow?
Keigo: Tomorrow

412
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:16,233
Junki: We know that, right?

413
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,066
Ruki: Keigo, do you know?

414
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,833
Keigo: Well that's why I asked

415
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,366
Ruki: You know hence you gave the question, right?

416
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:22,500
Ruki: Shion?

417
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,900
Keigo: Then can I ask? Syoya what is it?

418
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,566
Syoya: Then, Greenery Day

419
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:28,099
Keigo: It's wrong
Syoya: It's wrong?

420
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:29,966
Ruki: Shion, Shion
Shion: Huh?

421
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:30,700
Keigo: Shosei

422
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,066
Sho: What day is it, Shosei?

423
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,299
Shosei: Ohira Shosei Day

424
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,133
You just wanted to do that

425
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,033
Sho: By the way, Syoya you were right

426
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,200
Syoya: Really? Is it really correct?

427
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,666
Sho: Greenery Day

428
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,433
Keigo: No it's not?!

429
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,866
Ruki: The ones who got it right get shocked

430
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,066
Junki: It's Greenery
Keigo: It's not

431
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:51,599
Sho: It's Greenery

432
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,099
Keigo: Ah, really?

433
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:52,533
Sho: Yes

434
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:55,400
Takumi: He asked though he didn't know

435
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,000
Ruki: By the way who wrote the 'see you later' on twitter?

436
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,799
Ruki: Who wrote the 'see you later'?

437
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,599
Junki: That's me

438
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,433
Ruki: Ah, is that so

439
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:03,066
Junki: Yes

440
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:03,666
Ruki: Heh~

441
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:04,733
Ren: xD 'heh~'

442
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,066
Syoya: No interest!

443
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,099
Sho: That was a little sad

444
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,533
Ruki: Everyone was curious

445
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,466
Ruki: And this is what it is, that kind of 'heh~'

446
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:18,733
Sho: Couldn't you be a little more...

447
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,433
Ruki: A 'thank you for answering' kind of 'heh~'

448
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,000
Junki: It was halfhearted

449
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:27,166
Ruki: Sorry about that. Sorry if I made you feel that way

450
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,900
Ruki: My shyness came out

451
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:35,400
Sho: It wouldn't anymore!
Mame: Why would your shyness come out now

452
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,933
Shion: There are many interesting comments
Ruki: There are

453
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,400
Sukai: Everyone is writing pretty seriously

454
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,500
Ren: There's an interesting comment about Junki

455
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:46,633
Sho: What is it?
Keigo: Go ahead

456
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:50,333
Ren: I think this question has good sense

457
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,900
Ren: 'JO1's BRAIN Junki-kun'

458
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,833
Junki: Yes! It has come

459
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,066
Ren: What is a Japanese word you learnt recently?
[I think this is often asked to K-pop idols learning Japanese]

460
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:02,933
Shion: How you think of this is important

461
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,133
Ren: This pressure!

462
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,733
Shosei: Tsurubo's word...

463
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,566
Shion: How will you think of this?

464
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:14,366
Shion: By the way, you can't escape

465
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:16,833
Takumi: Scary!

466
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,333
Shosei: We're marking you with all our might

467
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,833
Sho: As time passes, your (?) reduces

468
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,666
Ruki: The Ogiri* brothers are watching
[*Some sort of entertainment style]

469
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,633
Sho: Ogiri brothers!

470
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:34,166
Junki: Okay

471
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,033
Ask the question once more

472
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:41,533
Keigo: Kono Junki, What is the Japanese word you learnt recently?

473
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,766
Junki: Okinotori Island

474
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,033
Ren: I like it though
Shion: Is that recent?

475
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,099
Junki: Recently...that's right

476
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:56,900
Keigo: Rather than a word it's...well it is a word, I guess

477
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,333
Shion: I know

478
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,833
Ruki: It seems there's a Japanese he learnt recently

479
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,233
Really? What is it?

480
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:08,733
Keigo: Tsurubo Shion, What is the Japanese word you learnt recently?

481
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:09,799
Shion: Toilet bowl

482
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,633
Sho: Why are you clapping!

483
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:18,299
Junki: This is weird...this is weird!

484
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:23,599
Shosei: It was good

485
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,266
Keigo: Ohira Shosei, What is the Japanese word you learnt recently?

486
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:31,466
Shosei: Weather

487
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,533
Shion: I like this
Junki: This is good

488
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,599
Ren: None of the staff are laughing

489
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:42,333
Keigo: It's ZERO

490
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,066
Shosei: I'm sorry

491
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,099
Junki: Because JAM are kind

492
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,433
Junki: I believe that they are laughing

493
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,666
Ren: It says 'I can't stop smiling in the train'

494
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,833
Sho: They're watching in the train?
Ren: They're watching in the train

495
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,400
Keigo: Because it's Shosei Day, right?

496
00:25:57,966 --> 00:25:59,666
Takumi: The comments are so fast

497
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,133
Sho: The comments are so fast I can't read it

498
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,666
Sho: Even if I try to stop it, it moves on its own

499
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,400
Junki: Today's TMI

500
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,566
What is TMI?

501
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,799
Junki: It's really...(mispronounces)

502
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,566
(making fun)

503
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:15,400
Junki: Not a big thing, that happened to yourself

504
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,333
Keigo: That happened recently
Ren: To yourself

505
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,500
Junki: A really tiny news

506
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:22,766
Syoya: Ah yes
Sho: Yes

507
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:26,299
Syoya: I had a meal from the Kono family

508
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:27,766
Junki: That's right

509
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:29,233
Why? When?

510
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:32,599
Junki: Right now my dad & mom are at my house

511
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:37,400
Junki: Then they happened to ask me 'call Kimata-kun over'

512
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Shosei: Invite us too!

513
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,500
Keigo: They came to Japan to play?

514
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,566
They are from Japan in the first place

515
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,799
Keigo: They're travelling within Japan

516
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:46,433
Junki: That's right

517
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:47,066
Syoya: It was yummy

518
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:47,733
Junki: It was yummy

519
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:48,900
What did you eat?

520
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,799
Syoya: Hamburger

521
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:51,866
That's nice!

522
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:52,866
Invite us

523
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,333
Keigo: The most homely taste

524
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,366
Syoya: And miso soup

525
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:57,200
Ren: There's 9 more days, can we make it?

526
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,633
Junki: Everyone, please come

527
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,000
Sho: You're inviting us 2-on-1?

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,966
Ruki: 'Please come' you say, but it's tough on your parents!

529
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:04,599
Keigo: They can't cook that much

530
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,866
Sho: They're probably watching now

531
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,299
Junki: Right, they're probably watching

532
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,666
Takumi: Plus it was quite big

533
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:10,599
Syoya: Ah, it was big

534
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:15,299
Syoya: I could taste the homely-ness

535
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,900
Keigo: Who else has a tiny news?
Shosei: Mame-chan?

536
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,466
Tiny news

537
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:27,833
Sho: Just now, Syoya, was that tiny?

538
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,933
Junki: That's a little bigger
Syoya: It may be a bit big

539
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:32,533
Sho: That is considered big, huh...what is it

540
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,133
Keigo: Something a little smaller

541
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,833
Syoya: It should be from today

542
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,833
Today?

543
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,033
No, just recently

544
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:41,533
Junki: Recently is fine too

545
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,433
Sukai: I have something

546
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,166
Please, what is it?

547
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,366
Sukai: I just noticed it today

548
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:49,866
Ruki: Really?

549
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,599
Sukai: My contacts...eh?

550
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,900
Sukai: I lost my contact lenses

551
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,133
Sukai: And I'm wondering how I'll go about tomorrow

552
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:05,033
Sukai: This is quite serious, I was discussing with our manager Naoto-san earlier

553
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,466
Sukai: 'What should I do?'

554
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:08,033
Keigo: That's a big news

555
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,533
Big news

556
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:13,200
Keigo: Something smaller

557
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,633
Sho: Small?

558
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:16,833
Syoya: Your contact lenses

559
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,966
Syoya: I see...

560
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:21,799
Sho: Something happened to Syoya

561
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,433
Syoya: I was thinking it's difficult

562
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,633
Sukai: Is there anything, everyone?
Shosei: We would like to know instead

563
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,233
Sho: Tiny information?

564
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:38,233
Sho: Isn't it that? From 18:00 is With Us MV release

565
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,966
Hey! That's a big news!

566
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,266
Junki: Don't say that as a TMI

567
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:51,066
Ren: That's too light! Say it properly!

568
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,166
Junki: A little more...what time is it?

569
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,733
Sho: It's :43 now

570
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,833
Just a little bit more

571
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:01,066
Ruki: Sho-kun did you have a TMI?

572
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:02,700
Sho: Something small, right?

573
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,966
Ruki: Really small

574
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:07,099
Sho: Wait I'll try to remember, please connect (the
conversation)

575
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:10,066
Ruki: Can it be really small?

576
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,599
Sho: We wouldn't remember something small

577
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,033
Junki: Really small

578
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,033
Syoya: Unexpectedly I think about it

579
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,833
Sho: Unexpectedly you think about it...what is small?

580
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,099
Junki: Like it will definitely happen today
Sho: It will definitely happen today...

581
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,033
Junki: It should
Sho: It should...

582
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:24,366
Keigo: But it's true we may forget because it's so small

583
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:27,366
Shosei: Eh? Something that happened? Not something that made us happy?

584
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,099
Ren: Whatever is fine
Shosei: Whatever is fine?

585
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,533
Sukai: Any kind of news

586
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:34,333
Keigo: It's not really small, but I'll connect it (to Sho)

587
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:40,000
Ren: 'I'll connect it~'

588
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,033
Keigo: LET ME SPEAK

589
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,233
Sukai: He's connecting the conversation

590
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:52,000
Keigo: Enough about the connecting, let me speak

591
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,599
Sukai: Sho-kun please think of something, because it'll connect

592
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,366
keigo: And if you already remember, please say it

593
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,933
Keigo: Yesterday I slept at 21:30 for the first time in a long while

594
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,099
Shosei: That's early

595
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,633
Keigo: And I slept until about 12:00

596
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,166
Ren : Oh, 12 noon?

597
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,599
Keigo: I slept for so many hours
Shion: About 14

598
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,466
Keigo: I was shocked, myself

599
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:21,833
Sukai: Without waking up?
Keigo: Without waking up

600
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,466
Wow

601
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:26,000
Keigo: I think it's the first time I slept this long

602
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,233
keigo: What's with that

603
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:33,099
Ruki: I thought you must be so tired, and got a good rest

604
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:41,400
Keigo: The way he's listening...

605
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,733
He's messing around

606
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:43,933
Ruki: I'm not messing around

607
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:46,733
Ruki: I was listening properly

608
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,833
Ruki: Probably most aren't even listening to Keigo's story

609
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,033
Keigo: It's real. Does anyone have this?

610
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,033
Ruki: Sleeping this long?
Keigo: Yeah

611
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:56,000
No. Not recently

612
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,900
Keigo: When I woke up I opened my eyes

613
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,633
Keigo: I couldn't see anything

614
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,033
Keigo: It was full of eye gunk

615
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,733
Sukai: Don't say such things!

616
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,799
Shosei: It's a joke

617
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,233
Keigo: I slept too much...

618
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,566
Keigo: For real!

619
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:19,633
Ruki: Umm...Can we have the person on the right answer soon

620
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:22,200
Shosei: It's hard to talk after you raised it to this level

621
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,133
Sho: I'm really sorry, I have nothing

622
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:31,433
Sho: It's too interesting here, I ended up like this

623
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,033
Ruki: You ended up listening
Sho: I did

624
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:35,099
Sho: Shall we do screenshot time now?

625
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,033
Syoya: We can do screenshot time from here

626
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:49,733
That side?

627
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,866
Syoya: Everyone, make yourself seen

628
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:52,700
Keigo: KP

629
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,233
Sho: What is KP?

630
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:55,133
Kanpai (cheers)

631
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,433
Syoya: It's screenshot time

632
00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,066
Junki: Thank you

633
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:10,433
Syoya: Ok! Did you take a lot?

634
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,099
Sho: Did you take a lot?
Shosei: Yes!

635
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:27,633
Keigo: Is it free talk now?

636
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:28,266
Sho: Well yes there's-

637
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,566
Keigo: Okay so recently

638
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:37,666
Keigo: It's a really small talk

639
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:41,299
Keigo: Umm...what was it...uh...

640
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:46,066
Keigo: When I'm doing something, I make a sound

641
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,466
Keigo: I think during shooting I talked to Ren-kun & Takumi about it

642
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:53,366
Keigo: What did I say? When I do something...

643
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:54,766
Sho: What do you mean?

644
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,166
Sho: Remember it

645
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
Sho: When you do something

646
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,266
Ren: Right...for me...

647
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:04,599
Keigo: This is really funny

648
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,900
Takumi: For example, like (sound effect)

649
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:11,400
Keigo: Like when you do this, and you make a sound

650
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,633
Keigo: It's a little embarrassing

651
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,400
Sho: You do it subconsciously

652
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,266
Keigo: Like (sound) comes out

653
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:21,099
Keigo: There's someone who makes a unique one

654
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:29,366
Ren: When I come out of the bath and dry my hair

655
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:31,766
Ren: I don't do it like this, but like this

656
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:32,799
Oh I get it. Facing down

657
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,299
Ren: I'm the type who looks down and does it

658
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:38,333
Ren: At that time, I rub it like this so

659
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,133
(Ren noises)

660
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,066
Keigo: He makes a sound

661
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:54,066
Ren: Really...when I was in middle school...my mom was like...

662
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:58,333
Ren: 'Why do you always make a sound?'

663
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:03,066
Ren: She told me. Before that I never noticed

664
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,199
Ren: After that I became aware that I was saying it

665
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,333
Ren: No, someone definitely says it too

666
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:16,699
No we don't

667
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,933
Junki: I can't this is too funny

668
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:22,333
Keigo: I laughed a lot when we talked about it

669
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:24,900
Takumi: We were like 'EHH?' right?

670
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,333
Sho: What about Keigo?

671
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,566
Keigo: Mine was funny too
Ren: What was it

672
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:41,266
Keigo: Right, I forgot

673
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,599
Ren: Yet you brought it up

674
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:46,266
Shosei: You don't know but you said it

675
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,900
Keigo: Mine is funny too. When it's funny it comes out

676
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,966
Sho: Like when you sleep?
Keigo: No that's sleep talking

677
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:56,433
Shion: That's famous

678
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,366
Keigo: Sleep talk is funny

679
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,199
Sho: Do you think you can recall?
Keigo: Impossible

680
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,133
Sho: Impossible, huh

681
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,633
Ren: If you can recall it

682
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:06,500
Sho: If you remember it before this ends
Keigo: Until the end

683
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,699
Sho: With that, the fun talk is coming to an end

684
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:20,300
Sho: With Us MV will be released on JO1 official YouTube Channel at 18:00 via premiere

685
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,266
Please watch it!

00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:25,699
Ren: It's premiering now

00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:29,133
AHHHHH

688
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:30,000
Shion: Oh no oh no

689
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,666
Sukai: It spilled

690
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,733
IT SPILLED

691
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,733
BYE BYE

692
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:35,833
Sukai: Tissue

693
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,133
Sho: Keigo's face...

694
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,000
Sho: He can't recall

695
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,666
Keigo did you recall something?

696
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,466
Shosei: Nothing!

697
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:47,933
Shosei: Nothing!

698
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,366
