1
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:07,533
Everyone, it has started!

2
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,069
This is Kimata's Freestyle Game Play

3
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:11,074
Now I am playing a random game

4
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:13,158
I jumped!

5
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:21,719
Ah, it's here

6
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:23,661
Eh?

7
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:24,486
There you go

8
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:41,057
How is the life status of the main character

9
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:41,710
There you go

10
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:43,482
See, there it is

11
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,019
That hurts

12
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,727
It hurts

13
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:58,795
Should I go here?

14
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:00,504
It disappeared

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Stage 2

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,862
This is a type of game with no ending

17
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:09,636
He is cute, I wonder what is his name

18
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,366
That is scary

19
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:27,334
I have wanted to do a Game Play

20
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:29,091
Now I am happy that I can do it

21
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:31,091
Hold on, wait a sec...

22
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,349
Oh my god!

23
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:41,518
