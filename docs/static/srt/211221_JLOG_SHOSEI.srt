I bought it

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
Hello! This is Ohira Shosei

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,340
Today, I'm going to see autumn leaves

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,540
And I also want to go to various places

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,650
Everyone, please follow me!

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,190
Firstly, I will go to a place called "Awesome Store"

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,260
Here it is

[Arrival at The Store]

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,030
I'm going in~

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,630
(excited)

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,000
It's my first time in "Awesome Store"

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
Awesome! It's so cute~

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,960
Eh?!

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,840
Look! It's a sponge with ruler shape

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,740
Cool!

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,250
I saw this place on the television

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,080
Since then I've always wanted to visit here

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,590
The purpose of this shopping is..

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,490
I wanted some Christmas stuff

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,790
So I came here

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,100
I also wanted to give something for the members

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,530
I'm considering that

23
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,770
This is amazing! This hanger is very convenient, isn't it?

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,710
What do you hang on it?

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,580
I want some chopsticks

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,550
Hyaa~~

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,820
I've arrived

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,820
I'm here

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,980
Wow!

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,360
So many varieties of stuff

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,390
The size for small kid is cute

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,130
Is it for boys?

34
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,540
I want to give this to my little niece

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,040
(fits perfectly)

36
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,920
I want to film J-LOG around Christmas time

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,620
JAMs, look forward to it!

38
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,160
There are various places I want to visit

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,390
[All-out Shopping Starts]

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,730
Okay

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,470
This hat is nice

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,840
I will buy for all members

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay!

44
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,620
Only for this once

45
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,930
I will bring them back for the members

46
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,460
I'll buy and bring them home

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,930
May I have the bill please?

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,070
Thank you very much

49
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,270
I bought these successfully

50
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,880
For the members

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
And for me

🍮 Nice 🍮

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,320
It's a nice day. It's a good start

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,620
I'm a bit hungry, so I will go to a café

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Bye bye~

56
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,960
Shosei's recent news is that

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,560
He's laughing cheerfully everyday

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,500
Anything else?

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,570
I wonder what

60
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,600
What is it?

61
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,080
I started to play Pokémon Diamond and Pearl*
(*T/N: A video game)

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,110
I'm moving forward with a good feeling

63
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,580
You know what? Today is really..

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,820
When I walk outside

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,640
I always wear a hat

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,920
I've always worn it for the past 2 or 3 years

67
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,060
It's been a long time since I walked outside without a hat

[Arrived at A Café!]

69
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,660

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,400
It's the next..

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,370
It's the next target

73
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,470
It looks so tasty
(laughs)

74
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,170
Looks so delicious

75
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,540
He's doing a thumbs up with a smug face

76
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,650
He's going to make a fist

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,410
Perhaps it's quite delicious then

78
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,000
Wait!

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,990
Even tomato pasta with pork and chickpeas

80
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,550
With salad, soup, and drink is here

81
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,290
For me it's seaweed paella after all

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,690
Th- Thanks for your hard..

83
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,590
(laughs)

84
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,160
Seaweed paella

85
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,160
Yes!

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
And the drink is cola

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
Thanks for your help

88
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,340
I said "Thank you for your hard work" when I met the waiter for the first time

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,650
[Selfie Time]

90
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,890
Very nice!

91
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,890
This is definitely a Twitter-upload worthy

92
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,060
Thank you for the food

93
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,200
By the way

94
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,930
Seems like the paella needs to be eaten immediately

95
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,420
Awesome!

96
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,690
Nom~ Nom~

97
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
My mother told me

98
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,600
That I should never leave my meal unfinished

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,900
When I asked why..

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,300
Eh? Was it my grandmother?

101
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,010
She told me "Gods dwell in each grain of rice"*
(*T/N: A saying usually being told to Japanese children. We shouldn't waste a single grain that was grown and delivered to us by various beings)

102
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,710
I didn't believe it at all

103
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,980
(laughs)

104
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,080
Honestly, I think Gods do exist

105
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,580
Well, I think they have affection (towards me)

106
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,200
I was raised

107
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,620
With this kind of teaching

108
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,460
Back then, my way of holding chopsticks was really bad

109
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,970
I had been doing it like this all the time

110
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,770
My mother worked really hard to fix this

111
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,540
But I didn't get better at all

112
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,510
When I entered high school, I watched YouTube and got it fixed

113
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,440
I thought YouTube was great

114
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,680
My mother was surprised

115
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,900
It was delicious

116
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,430
Thank you for the food

117
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,140
Then the last thing is

118
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,810
It's autumn foliage season now

119
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,050
So I came to a ginkgo tree-lined avenue

120
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,550
Wow that's so beautiful! Amazing

121
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,660
(Tada!)

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
So pretty~

123
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,220
Awesome

124
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,240
The weather is nice too

125
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,510
It's like we're in Harry Potter

126
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Wait a minute

127
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,620
You see

128
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,500
Too many people here

129
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,790
For Ohira who is not good at having too many people around him

130
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,190
The pressure was quite on a high level

131
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,130
But I was glad I could enjoy it for a bit

132
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,200
As soon as I said the avenue was full of people

133
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,770
I spotted a good place

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Alright!

135
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,400
So nice!

136
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
Yes! Umm~

137
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,470
It's getting cold so I'm going home~
