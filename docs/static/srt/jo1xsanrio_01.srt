198
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,525
No...actually we don't really know...

199

I thought so

200
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,227
Director doesn't know either?

201
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,329
You don't know, do you?

202
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,397
My apologies

203

Let's have a look at this
[Let's look at the video prepared by intern Mamehara]

205
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,509
Cool~

206
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,611
The white-haired guy is good at dancing

207
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,083
It's cute~

208
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,586
It's refreshing

209
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,086
Wow

210
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:07,987
Everyone is handsome

211
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,621
Yeah

212
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,259
- What was that?
- The vibe has changed

213
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,329
This kid seems good at singing

214
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,165
I see. Ahh it's cool

215
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,102
Isn't that guy the coolest?

216
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,403
Yeah, he's the coolest

217
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,705
He's the coolest

218
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,008
Doesn't he look a little like Kawanishi-kun?

219
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,909
[Like twins, identical]

220
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,444
He looks like you a little

221
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,414
I see!

222
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,186
[Before making the new character,
the Marketing Dept first has to learn properly about JO1]

223
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,389
Everyone, please watch and learn from this properly

224
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,658
Yes! I will learn from this!

225
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,895
Isn't the intern the most solid one here?

226
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,896
Intern, you did well

227
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,902
We want to make a JO1 character with Sanrio-san

228
00:08:55,902 --> 00:09:00,740
Next time, how about we all go to Sanrio Puroland for an on-site training?

229
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:02,642
That's wonderful

230
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,610
That's wonderful

231
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,279
That's a good idea!

232
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,381
Can we simply go for a on-site training like that?

233
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,916
Rest assured, everyone

234
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,818
I know Cinnamon's contact

235
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,419

238
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,425
No, no, that's impossible!

239
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:22,094
Ah

240

242

Are you serious?

243
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,436
Does Cinnamon have a smartphone?

244
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,704
Hello! Cinnamon-san?

245
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,541
You collaborated with JO1 for a dance, right?

246
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,378
- Oh, that's right!
- That's true, I recall there was something like that

247

We would like to make JO1's character in collaboration with Sanrio-san

249

Oh?

250

Oh!

251
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,089
You'll talk to a higher-up for us?

252
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,757
