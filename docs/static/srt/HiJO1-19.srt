It was a hot match between men

181
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,102
Ah, that's enough

182
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,772
[In contrast to the hot battle, a cool finale]

183
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,240
[Cry]

184
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,777
We're curious...please announce his timing

185
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,379
Syoya's time...

186
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,849
12min 21s

187
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,919
Wow! Nice fight!

188
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,491
Rather than speed, we watched a drama
[Well done]

189
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,026
Ruki you did your best too

190
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,562
Rather than a drama, I saw stars

191
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,199
Here we go

192
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,835
The 5th match is Sato Keigo vs Kono Junki!

193
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,936
[I'll do my best!]
[Pose & expression opposite]

194
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,704
Alright, let's have a word of enthusiasm from each side

195
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,708
This is my first meal in 3 days

196
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,477
Thank you [monotone]

197
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,313
In reality, it's about half a day

198
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:00,913
Do your best

199
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,950
I prepared just for this
[Ready]

200
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,651
- What about Sato Keigo?
- I'm full

201
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,686
Oh?

202
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,588
But I would like to finish eating

203
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,557
Okay then, the 5th match...

204
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,725
Ready...

205
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:13,793
Start!

206
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,460
Go!

207
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,161
How will it go?

208
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,596
Just do your best!

209
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,431
Oh Junki is quite fast!
[2 of them go at high speed from the start]

210
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,032
Keigo is fast too!
[2 of them go at high speed from the start]

211
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,367
Keigo is unexpectedly fast
[2 of them go at high speed from the start]

212
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,502
Go go go

213
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,103
Junki is really fast

214
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,072
Junki is crazy

215
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,940
How does everyone eat without chewing?

216
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,575
He's practically drinking it

217
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,912
Their seconds aren't even speaking
[Both seconds desperately keeping up]

218
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,047
This is variety, please say something

219
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,683
Junki is fast!

220
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,819
He's just left with 2...4...6! Wow!

221
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:40,953
He's finished more than half!

222
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,555
You're doing it

223
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:42,955
Yum!

224
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,791
You're number one

225
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:46,759
Don't make him laugh

226
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,560
You're number ONE

227
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,196
He's so fast! Wow!

228
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,738
Junki is so freaking fast!

229
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,473
Keigo-kun, is it yummy?

230
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,607
Junki is about to finish

231
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,809
Last spurt!

232
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,610
You're too fast!

233
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,645
Last spurt!

234
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,147
Put it in your mouth and you're done

235
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,818
Put it in your mouth...and you're...done!

236
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,120
[DONE!]

237
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,755
[With shocking speed,
Junki 20 bowls complete]

238
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,823
Junki has finished!
[Yay!]

239
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,792
He's amazing

240
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,128
There's a monster among us

241
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,831
- But Keigo is fast too
- He's fast!

242
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,832
Really fast!

243
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,901
Let's show our manly side!
[Setting up]

244
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,404
[Man who does what he says, Keigo]

245
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,506
- His manliness is amazing
- Wonderful

246
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,742
His body is starting to tremble

247
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,978
- Is this the last?
- No, he has 1 more bowl

248
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,713
You're almost done, Keigo-kun

249
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,915
- With this...
- Last!

250
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,483
Keep the time properly

251
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,619
Once you put it in your mouth...you're done

252
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,153
Ok!

253
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,888
Done!
[Keigo 20 bowls complete]

254
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,190
You're done. Wonderful
[In a daze]

255

This is crazy
[Applause for the hot match]

256
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,127
This is really tough

257
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,762

2min 42s!

262
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,803
Fast!
[Great struggle]

263
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:10,676
Can Junki set a new record!?

264
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,979
Right, and Kono Junki who we are curious about...

265
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,547
- Wait a minute...
- This is seriously crazy

266
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,348
The time...

267
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,283

- Wow! Amazing!
- A monster

272

- Are you for real?
- Gross! [disbelief]

273
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:29,962
I mean it was like...

274
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,767
There's already a 20sec difference between this

275
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,970
How about you stop being the main vocal and be the main competitive eater?

276
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,773
Main competitive eater

277
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,175
- You're crazy
- You can't do it like this

278
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,577
[Rather than accumulating in the mouth,]

279
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,012
You have to get it down
[Swallow strategy]

280
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,414
So my way was no good

281
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,782
When it got full, it became tough

282

I see

283
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,518
Keigo are you ok?
[Doesn't seem ok...]

284
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,755
Keigo-kun is fast too

285
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,289
Even though I did my best

286
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,925
This guy is too fast
[Junki at impossible speed]

287
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,761
He got all the attention

288

[High level battle]

289

[Proof(?) of hard work]

292

- There are noodles here
- Here?

293
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,041
I have noodles (men) here, and bamboo shoots (menma) here

294
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,643
It doesn't go up to the brain

295
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,312
Bamboo shoots and maybe my ears will have seaweed

296
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,881
- This whole thing...
- Becomes ramen?

297
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,915
Nice fight!

Go leader!

304
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,196
Due to the numbers, he is doing it alone
[Due to the numbers, solo participation]
