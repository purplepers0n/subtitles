The relaxed talk inevitably shifts to about Aomori]

365
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:50,329
Places with a lot of nature have beautiful skies 

366
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:50,963
It is

367
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,532
- The night sky was amazing
- It was

368
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,535
The view from the outdoor bath was amazing

369
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,104
- We could see everything
- The Orion was visible

370
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,342
In Tokyo if you look up, it's just full of clouds

371
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,411
The city is too bright

372
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,680
- Ah, that could be a reason
- Yeah, so you can't see the sky well

373
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,682
Is Shion legit sleeping?

374
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,950
Shion is sleeping

375
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,451
I have been sleeping

376
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,420
This place is comfortable

377
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,421
It really is

378
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,757
- Look, there's a drone
- Huh?

379
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,762
It's our drone

380
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,797
Bye bye!

381
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,007
[Dinnertime]

382
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,811
We all had fun at our various activities

383
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,279
How was it, Takumi-san?

384
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,050
I've never been able to try something like this before, so it was really fun

385
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,721
We rode a horse and went one round around the park

386
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,190
Did you hear us talking to you?

387
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,726
- We did
- But we couldn't tell what you were saying

388
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,060
But apparently Keigo-kun heard it

389
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,396
You said "What silly thing are y'all doing?!"

390
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,532
- We never said such terrible thing
- You didn't?

391
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,001
That's what I thought

392
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,770
He just says whatever he likes

393
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,738
We couldn't hear

394
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,040
We rode Kirara-chan

395
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,908
Kirara-chan?

396
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,576
That's the horse's name

397
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,377
I see

398
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,511
She has so much power!

399
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,013
How many horsepower do you think she has?

400
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:15,914
One horsepower

401
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,654
Alright then...

402
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,490
I think we're all hungry too

403
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:25,758
Have a look at this

404
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,193
- Amazing!
[Super luxurious dinner]

405
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,395
This has been prepared for us

406
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,095
What is this?

407
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,131
- Let's eat!
- Yes!

408
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,499
Ready, go

409
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,734
Thank you for the meal

410
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,169
This is amazing

411
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,539
Let's do cheers

412
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,684
Cheers~

413
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,822
Our breakfast was luxurious too, but this is special

414
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,023
- Right?
- Yum!

415
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,927
[Yum!]

416
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,396
Are these the scallops we caught in the afternoon?

417
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,732
Probably not

418
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,502
When JO1 eats good food everyone stops talking

419
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,704
So good!

420
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,871
[Yum ♥]

421
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,540
[Good]

422
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,843
I want to go around the country with everyone and eat all the foods

423
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,245
Eat all the delicious foods across the country with the members

424
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,113
That's right

425
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,754
[It was too delicious that everyone continued to eat quietly]

426
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,757
[What's after the meal...?]

427
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:41,900
[Winter Camp ends with members enjoying free time]

428
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,009
[How was Winter Camp?]

429
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,378
This time Sukai joins us too

430
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,680
And we ate a lot of good food

431
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,849
And it's also my first time in Aomori

432
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,550
So it was really fun

433
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,254
The greatness of Aomori, like the food and scenery

434
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,991
Being able to share that with everyone

435
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,826
It was a joyous time

436
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,432
It felt like a family trip

437
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:17,569
I was tasked to wake the members

438
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:23,776
You could see the individuality of each member

439
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:29,848
Once again, I felt like I could see the members comfortable selves

440
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,985
As an older brother

441
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,954
I could see the younger brothers' growth

442
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,023
It was a warm and fluffy Winter Camp

443
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:43,162
[What's your impression of Aomori?]
- Onsen and the fresh air

444
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,897
The scenery is beautiful too

445
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,666
The seafood is delicious too

446
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,635
The apples are delicious too

447
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,570
I'm really satisfied

448
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,407
The food is so delicious I could eat it forever

449
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,144
I'm sure I'll put on weight in Aomori

450
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,682
The stars are beautiful and the air is fresh

451
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,017
I was stunned

452
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,820
I would like to come again

453
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,556
That's how nice this place is

454
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:16,428
[What do you want to try in the next Winter Camp?]
- I've only tried it twice, but I want to try snowboarding

455
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:17,729
Snowboarding

456
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,899
I've tried snowboarding once

457
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,136
But I only have memories of falling on my butt

458
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,905
But now, I think I could do it

459
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,441
I want to try it while being taught by the members

460
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,343
I want to make an ice temple

461
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,378
[Where do you want to go for the next Winter Camp?]
- Hokkaido

462
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,481
[Where do you want to go for the next Winter Camp?]
- I think I want to go to Hokkaido

463
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,150
If I were to build an ice temple...

464
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,421
I want to build it with all my might at a place like Hokkaido

465
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,990

[One word to describe "With Us"?]
- Bond

467
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:54,199
Us being here is also thanks to JAM

468
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,935
In our daily activities

469
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,139
We align our steps

470
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,075
To walk towards our various goals

471
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,945
Aside from JAM, I also have the members

472
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:12,985
And though you can't see them, the staff who are supporting us

473
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,557
It's a song with all of that packed into it, so my word is "bond"

474
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,960
[What made you feel a bond with members recently?]
- Arena Tour

475
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,765
We managed to complete KIZUNA

476
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:31,570
We managed to perform in front of everyone as 11 including Sukai for the first time

477
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,441
And we managed to complete it without injury or sickness

478
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,112
So that was a moment that made me feel the bond

479
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,915
It was something we all wanted to do

480
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,684
And that was granted to us by JAM

481
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,120
So there's a feeling of everyone becoming One

482
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:56,929
[What left an impression on you from "With Us" MV filming?]
- We started makeup at 3am I think?

483
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,033
There was a scene that I was running in the early morning

484
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,634
At a place like a sandy beach

00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,537
Me, Sho-kun & Junki-kun

486
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:10,475
Running in the desert when it was pitch black

487
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:15,180
Then there was a scene where I encountered Sho-kun

488
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,617
We laughed a little

489
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,452
That was fun

490
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:27,226
Jasmine-chan who showed up in the MV was the cutest

491
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,230
She was so cute and friendly to people
