1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420
So fast

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,920
I was charging it

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,500
It's definitely charging

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,340
Oh, it has started

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
HELLO, I'M RUKI!!!
Sorry to have made you waiting

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,100
HELLO, I'M OHIRA SHOSEI!!!
Please take care of us!

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,860
- Everyone, sorry to have made you wait
- Thank you for waiting

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,580
Your smile is "Love & Peace"

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,840
This is "Louis Vuitton" Shiroiwa Ruki.
Please take care of me

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,900
Uhh.. "A heart.. in your heart".
I am Ohira Shosei

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,780
Please take care of us

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,290
We will start it

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,270
To everyone who is bored staying at home

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,230
I hope you find energy even if it's just a little

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,480
We, JO1, are doing live broadcast since yesterday

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,200
And we change the members in charge everyday!

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,650
Oh~ Nice kids

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,900
I'll get right to it, please look at the back!

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,900
There's homework given by Shion and Sho-kun yesterday

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,660
- And that homework is..
- The homework is..

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,020
Blow a kiss, please!

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,260
What should we do? Doing this early in the morning, from the beginning?

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,980
Or should we do it as a gift for the viewers

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,480
Who are watching till the end?

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,770
- Let's do that! Let's do it at the end
- Then, let's leave it until the end

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,000
You might probably be busy, but everyone please watch until the end! My apologies

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,100
My apologies

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,790
Okay! So first of all, let's do the first segment!

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,230
The first segment is JO1's weather talk!

30
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,940
The curtains are closed, so I don't know the weather today

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,300
According to the information I know, it seems it's raining

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,360
- It seems like it, right?
- Right

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,490
- So, you should dry your laundry inside the house
- Yes!

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,140
- Also for everyone not to go out much, right?
- Yep! Try not to go out

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,230
In times like this and it's raining. It's dangerous,
so if possible! Please refrain from it

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,200
And it's getting warm these days.
The temperature difference between night and day is huge

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,460
So, please bring your coat when you go out

38
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,840
Also since we started 5 minutes late,
we will end the live broadcast at 10:25!

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,620
- Everyone, I'm looking forward to work with you!
- Looking forward!

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:15,080
So, what about the area where you live?
How is the weather?

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,930
- By the way, it's raining in our place, isn't it?
- It's raining for us

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,020
How many people are watching this?

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,170
Is there anyone from a sunny area?

44
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,540
Rain in Saitama, rain in Aomori too

45
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,680
"It's s clear sky here!"

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Clear sky is nice

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,020
It's sunny in Kyushu too, isn't it?

48
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,640
Sho-san's energy always goes down on rainy days

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,120
There are a lot of comments. I'm happy

50
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,360
16,000 viewers? Awesome!

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,440
I've done some live broadcasts back then

52
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,420
- So, I kinda get it. Comments like these..
- Nostalgic

53
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,640
They lift up your spirit for sure, right?

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,240
There is a comment, "Do you like Todoroki-kun? Do you like HeroAca*?"
(*T/N: The anime 'My Hero Academia'. Shosei's Zoom nickname is Todoroki-kun, a character from the show)

55
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,060
- Well, Shosei and I like Todoroki and Bakugo
- Yes

56
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,400
- I love HeroAca, too
- I love Todoroki. He is cool

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,520
I attached a protector on the tip of my iPhone's charger...On this part..

58
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,380
They sell Todoroki and Bakugo ones, so I use them

59
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,700
- I want to buy it, too. It's so nice
- Yeah, it's so cute

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,980
They said, "It's sunny in Shikoku", "Osaka, too"

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,660
So, it's raining in the eastern region I guess

62
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,000
It's also cloudy in Aichi

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,720
Then, let's go to the next segment!

64
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,550
Next up is JO1's "Omikuji!"*
(*T/N: fortune-telling paper strip)

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,240
- Shosei, please explain
- Alright

66
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,980
There are fortune cookies here

67
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:51,400
We will claim both of our and JAM's lot, then I will read the fortune

68
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,060
I only have to pick two of these, right? Probably

69
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,660
That's right. Are we doing this one by one?

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,380
- Ah, one by one. Then Shosei..
- Is it alright if we eat this?

71
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,740
- You take out the paper, right?
- Ah, that's..

72
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,140
Since it's not something to eat

73
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,940
Okay, I'll read it

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,180
This is awesome

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh!

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
Okay, my fortune is..

77
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,750
"Shokichi"*.. That's how you read this, right?
(*T/N: slightly good luck, fourth best fortune)

78
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,520
In the Shokichi, "You might get a stomachache"

79
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,060
And the lucky item is yellow monkey!

80
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,060
Here

81
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,540
- Are you saying it's Junki?
- Yup, that's what I'm talking about

82
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,040
If it's yellow monkey (then it's him)

83
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,110
Then I'll go with this

84
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,310
You're eating it!

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,020
Here I go

86
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,800
"Daikichi*!!"
(*T/N: excellent luck, the best fortune)

87
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,000
It says, "Let's go at our own pace today"

88
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,900
- My pace~ ♪
- It's "Young"

89
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,420
And the lucky item is..
This one is Junki as well

90
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,420
- Carbonara
- You're lying!

91
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,400
- Amazing!
- That's what it said

92
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,320
- Then I will go to Junki's room after this ends
- Yes. Me too

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,130
- This is JAM's lot
- Yes, please do JAM's turn

94
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,060
Alright. Here it is

95
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,880
OH!!

96
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,240
I'll do it

97
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,160
It's "Daidaikichi"!*
(*T/N: grand luck, best of the best fortune)

98
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,440
- Daidaikichi?
- There is Daidaikichi, you know? Wow!

99
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,580
What is that? Daidaikichi..

100
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,940
"Doing something embarrassing may bring good things!"

101
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,120
Your lucky item is JO1's members' wink

102
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,280
If that so, please do it

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,020
3, 2, 1! (winks)
Okay

104
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,680
Ruki-kun, please

105
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,840
Do we stick this on here?

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,860
Can you take this off?

107
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,600
So it's like that

108
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,770
I'm so bad at winking

109
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't do it. Really

110
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
- Look! See it?
- Ahaha

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm really bad at it

112
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,820
Then we'll stick these on

113
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,260
Here

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm not good at winking since a long time ago

115
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,380
I got it. So, it's like this

116
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,880
Ah, is that so?

117
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,260
Where do I have to stick this on?

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,060
Oh, I thought I was supposed to stick it on like this

119
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,660
- It was a mistake
- Really?

120
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,040
- Is this going to work?
- Yep

121
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,060
On the wall too

122
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,810
- Shosei, write for mine too
- Okay

123
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,580
- And write for JAM's paper too later
- Okay

124
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,900
- Ah, there is JAM's one here, too!
- Yes JAM's is already written

125
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,600
Thank you

126
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,700
- "It's 20,000 viewers soon!", they said. I'm glad!
- Crazy! Since morning..

127
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,760
Everyone, I'm so happy like this

128
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,160
It's amazing... They are joining Asakatsu (morning activity) for us

129
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
"Ruki-kun, please do a peace sign"

130
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,260
Haha, me too

131
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,480
"Shosei, put your hood on!"

132
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,980
With that, is it alright to move on to the next segment?

133
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,320
Then the next segment is..

134
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,100
Ah! Is it this one? Is this the next one?

135
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,420
The next segment is JO1's observation diary!

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
- Observation diary!
- That's right

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,220
What is that, Shosei-san?

138
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:37,480
Umm.. There is an exchange diary written by Shion-kun and Sho-san here. Let's read it!

139
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,650
- This diary, right?
- Yes!

140
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,840
Alright. I will read it~

141
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,980
Name..

142
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,880
Name: Kamome-chan

143
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,300
Date: May 18th
Weather: Cloudy

144
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,730
Things I've learnt: The container was too big for the sprouts to reach the water

145
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,300
The name is Kamome

146
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,640
It's name is Kamome-chan

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,060
- Kamome-chan?
- Correct

148
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,750
Then we will raise Kamome-chan

149
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,060
Yes. It's like that

150
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,200
So, what are we going to do?

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,020
Ah~! The staff soaked it in the water

152
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,140
I got it

153
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,830
Shall we see it?

154
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,260
Kamome-chan

155
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,310
Ah, I like this BGM

156
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
It seems the way they did it yesterday was wrong

157
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,580
The staff has helped to soak it in the water properly

158
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,840
"Let's write the name", they said

159
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,320
Do you mean to write Kamome-chan here?

160
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,000
Eh? What do you mean?

161
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,100
Then can I work on it?

162
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,560
- Ah, will you?
- Yes

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,700
OK. Then I'll read the comments

164
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,100
Oh.. It's nice, isn't it?
Isn't it a nostalgic sight?

165
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,060
There is a lot of comments like "Naoto's (Manager) way to raise the sprouts was wrong"

166
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,680
- Naoto-san..
- Yes

167
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,240
Well, Naoto-san got that side. He's clumsy

168
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,450
Alright

169
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,020
For your information, this isn't a choker but my clothes' tie

170
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,740
It's attached on here

171
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,400
So I just wrapped it around my neck and made it like a choker

172
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,220
The fashionable point

173
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,080
The tie is a bit long, so I'm just making it like a choker

174
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,160
Right

175
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,160
"Ruki, what time did you sleep last night?"

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,780
But these days.. I'm trying to sleep early diligently

177
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,240
Yesterday, too. Since there is this broadcast, I think I fell asleep around 1 a.m

178
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,400
Everyone, what time do you usually go to sleep?

179
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,280
"Ruki, wear your hood"

180
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,700
I don't wear it often

181
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,940
The reason I was late today isn't because the carriage is delayed. I'm sorry

182
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,640
I was in various meetings, so I was late. My apologies

183
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,840
Wonderful! A lot of comments are coming. I'm pleased

184
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,800
There is so many

185
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,140
Like this..

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,440
Amazing, right?

187
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,800
"I slept around that time, too"

188
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,980
Awesome!

189
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,240
Okay. I did it

190
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,760
Kamome-chan

191
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
Ah, Kamome has finally arrived
- Yes

192
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,620
The assignment is, we took the sprouts out of the water and sprayed them from the top

193
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,700
It seems there's a lot of things will be coming up from here

194
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,260
- Are you sure?
- Yes

195
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,540
- A week.. This would be possible in a week, right?
- Right!

196
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,740
I think it's fast

197
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,100
- Is it done?
- Yes, it is

198
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,560
This segment is for observation

199
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,660
- "Please put on the aluminum foil lid"
- Okay~

200
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,220
Is this right? Is it alright?

201
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,300
Is it correct this time?

202
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,660
I think it's correct this time

203
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,040
JAMs also have been together with us doing this since yesterday

204
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,840
Is there anyone among JAMs who grows this?

205
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,060
- I wonder if there is one
- It would be great if there is one

206
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,650
"Who drew the Kamome illustration?"

207
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,660
Ah, but there is already "Shion" written in here

208
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,360
But you won't see it clearly

209
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,420
It's nice, right?

210
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,000
- He signed it properly, too
- Okay

211
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,650
"What did you have for breakfast?"
I haven't eaten yet

212
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,640
Shosei, have you eaten already?

213
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,320
I left half of my breakfast

214
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,800
There wasn't time

215
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,420
Alright, it's done!

216
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,300
It's like this. I'll wrap this up

217
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,960
That's all. This has been our observation

218
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,900
We need to record the diary here properly later, right?

219
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,650
Well, then. Tomorrow..

220
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,400
Our observation diary

221
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,580
Should we go to the next segment?
The next one is..

222
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,200
- It's Higawari* segment, isn't it?
(*T/N: a segment that would change everyday)

223
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,240
Today's Higawari segment for me and Shosei is this one

224
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,460
Our Higawari segment is..

225
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,040
Ruki and Shosei's Zoom Impromptu Talk!

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,160
Let me tell you about this.. I don't like it.
I can't do things like this

227
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,700
It makes me a bit nervous

228
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,460
He has been like that even before the live broadcast started

229
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,310
You have to improvise, right?!

230
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,470
- Isn't it difficult?
- It is! Very difficult

231
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,040
- What should we do?
- What should we do?

232
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,840
Well, wouldn't the vibe work out somehow?

233
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,080
You said you wanted to do something, right?

234
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,380
I knew there's something that Shosei wants to do

235
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,120
But he didn't tell me at all before the live broadcast

236
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,140
I'm scared of what's going to happen

237
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,220
- Anyway.. Should we do it?
- OK

238
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,630
- We can do it with that, right? The background
- Yes. We can do that

239
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,040
If you please

240
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
Umm..

241
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,280
There it is. There it is

242
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,300
Ah, wait a second. This is difficult

243
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,780
Oops! Wait a minute

244
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,280
This is dangerous

245
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,780
How do you change this?

246
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,720
Can you do it?

247
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,780
My friend's picture just came up

248
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,520
No! Wait a moment

249
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,940
How can I turn this off?

250
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,040
Stupid!!! x4

251
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,880
Stupid! x3

252
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,060
This isn't it! Dummy!

253
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,610
Ah, is this it? Is this it? Okay~
That was dangerous!! You!

254
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,480
Is this it?

255
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,660
- Dangerous.. That was very dangerous
- It was really scary

256
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,600
Absolutely dangerous!
It was insane for a moment

257
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,340
So it's reversed. If you use
this virtual (background)

258
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,940
Now with this, the place is a basketball court

259
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,590
I was originally a soccer fan, so I'm not very familiar with basketball court

260
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,900
How- how are we going to sort this out?
Shall we get started?

261
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,760
Today is.. mini drama?

262
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,500
- I want to reenact the best scene in basketball
- That scene?

263
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,820
- Is that so?
- Yes!

264
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,450
I got it! How.. what should we do?

265
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,000
Which part.. How would we do it?
Which part are we going to do?

266
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,040
Then, I'll play the female role

267
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,320
Okay! x3

268
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,000

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,680
Long time ago...It's not that long time ago though

270
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,920
During a filming a month ago, when we got some free time

271
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,540
Unexpectedly there was a basketball court in the studio

272
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,380
So both of us...There was also a basketball

273
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
Right? We played basketball a brief, right?

274
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,980
Please see our trifling fast and short passes back then

275
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,180
- Let's say this Pompompurin is a ball
- Okay

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,360

Umm, I have a question for Shosei. Do you mind?

290
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,960
I've never asked this to anyone

291
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,560
This is trending nowadays.
I'm not sure whether you know this or not though

292
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,440
Let's say Shosei has a girlfriend a few years later

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,940
Kiss that girlfriend and get 10,000 yen

What would you do, Shosei?

- No but it's definitely the one I like...
- Girlfriend?

297
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,040
-Yes. My girlfriend
- You would kiss her and get the 10,000 yen?

298
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,220
- Yes. I will get the 10,000 yen
- Eh~

299
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,640
What do you understand from this?

300
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,650
If I were you, I'd kiss the world's most beautiful woman and get 80,000 yen

Since my girlfriend is the most beautiful woman in the world

303

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,840
- Yes, that's correct
- I got it

337
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,280
Please call me anytime

338
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,480
Oh, right! We haven't blown a kiss yet

339
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,980
We have to blow a kiss, at the end

340
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,900
- Please do it
- Alright

341
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,440
Oii!

342
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,070
Well then. See you again

343
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,740
Homework for the two members tomorrow

344
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,200
What is it?

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
Homework

346
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,220
Homework?

347
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,140
Is anything alright? What do we do?

Two persons in charge tomorrow are
Ren-kun and Sukai, The Tibetan Fox pair

349
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,500
The homework that we want the Tibetan Fox pair to do

350
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,040
- If we think about that..
- What should they do?

351
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,800
Then.. Let's see how good they are at talking with snow background

352
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,020
- Ah, you're talking about this, right?
- Correct!

353
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,680
I see

354
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,800
Just like this

355
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:35,780
Let's see how much they can hype things with this snow background

356
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:42,320
- We'd want the.. Tibetan Fox pair to do it tomorrow!
- Please do us this favor!
