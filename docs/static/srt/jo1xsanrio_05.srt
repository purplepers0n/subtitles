[Draft by the Director]

36
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:54,481
He's from Okinawa, so speaking of Okinawa, it's "Shisa". Everyone knows it, right?

37
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,316
It's Okinawa's guardian deity

38
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,719
So I wanted to add the Shisa

39
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,222
- And he loves coffee
- Yes

40
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,091

57

There has been information that Shiroiwa Ruki-san owns 3 poodles

58
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,346
So I made a character using the motif of a poodle

59
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:07,187
And his member colour is white, so I thought of making it a white fluffy poodle

60
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,922
- That's why it's white

Mamehara Issei-san looks like a puppy so I tried to show that

82
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,296
And he has a belt that writes 'mame'

83
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,698
- Whoa it writes 'mame'
- That's awesome

84

It seems that Kawashiri-san is said to look like a fox by his fans

101
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,360
So firstly I used the image of a fox

102
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,264
And his hobby is magic, so I used the image of a magician

103
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:36,436
He has a hat, and I drew a dove as his companion separately

104
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:40,940
But it could rest on his head, or be together with him

First of all, I'm in charge of Kinjo Sukai-san

I captured all the information about him

120

I created a character that matches some of those traits

Explain it!

124
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,842
His dream is to become a pilot when he grows older

125
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,679
And to fly in the sky, because his name is Sukai

126
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,048

128
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,919
You even wrote his height

129

He's 3-4 years old

130
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,156
- 3-4 years old!?
- He's huge!

131
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,290
But he's 150cm

132
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,259
That means he can grow even taller

It fell from the sky

it's name is 'Pocchari'?

156
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,549
No! It's characteristic is that it is 'pocchari'(chubby)

It's characteristic is chubby, I see

00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,717
The cover page

183
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,352
I kind of get it

184
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,089
Then, the drawing that Sanrio helped us with...

185
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,025
I want to see it

186
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,231
[Moved]

187
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,132
Really awesome!

188
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,266
Cute!

189
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,036
The wings are cute

190
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,473
The hair is a little long, perhaps they helped me lengthen it
[Hairstyle imitating Ohira-san]

191
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,710
Wonderful~ Thank you

192
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,848
This surprised me the most

193
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,083
Next is...

194
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,852
[Newbie Tsurubo's turn to present]

195
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,256
I was in charge of Tsurubo Shion-san

196
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,392
First, here's the original draft

197
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,765
It has a ton of individuality

198
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,900
Is it only the face?

199
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,236
It's a chihuahua

200
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,371
I see

201
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,007
I wonder how this turned out

202
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,442
- This is awesome!
[He checks it beforehand]

203
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,744
Because it only has the face

204
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,213
The individual characteristics may start to clash

205
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,682
I wonder what they decided to get rid of or keep

206
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:17,984
- Shall we look at it?
- Yes

207
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,618
Here it is

208
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:19,986
Cute!

209
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,662
They kept the cheek

210

The original image is...

211
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,298
The original image is...this

212
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,166
It's scary!

213
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,168
It properly turned into a 'Sanrio' character

214
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,441
I'm really really satisfied

215
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,376
Thank you very much

216
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,715
First of all...I'm a huge fan of Sato Keigo-san

217
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,022
I'm a huge fan so I was in charge of Sato Keigo-san

218
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,690
First...this

219
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,091
Here it is

220
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:01,961
The first plant

221
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,700
He likes pulling pranks like a Pierrot

222
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,736
So I tried to make it Pierrot-like

223
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:15,908
I drew it in a cute-weird way

224
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,243
Let's see how it turned out

225
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,210
Here we go

226
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,248
Cute!

227
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:22,848
Wow!

228
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,018
- It has the Pierrot-ness
- The body is awesome

229
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,622
They kept the freckles

230
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,324
Thank you very much

231
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,495
- He's satisfied
- I'm really satisfied

232
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,496
Thank you very much

233
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,966
I'm in charge of Kimata Syoya-kun, please treat me well

234
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,302
Let's have a look right away

235
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,873
He looks strong

236
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,343
Kimata-kun owns a bunny at home

237
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:51,977
I see

238
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,381
It also seems his fans say he looks like a bunny

239
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,850
So I used a bunny as the motif

240
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,319
His eyes are sparkly

241
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,154
Is this the point you were particular about?

242
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,790
Right, there are sparkly Sanrio characters

243
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,959
So I wanted to make it a bit sparkly

244
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,729
Then, let's have a look

245
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,363
How did it turn out?

246
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,471
Cute!

247
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,972
WAH IT'S CUTE

248
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,074
This part...

249
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,844

[That leaves Section Chief Kono]

00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,424
We're on to the last one

256
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,526
You must be used to presentations already

257
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,029
That's right. I've climbed up till this position, after all

258
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,132
[Is that person such an important person?]

259
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,033
You come this far with your presentation skills alone

260
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,335
That's right

261
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:55,875
I'm presenting Kono Junki-san's design, whom I was in charge of

262
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,742
That dude

263
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,677
Don't say 'that dude'!

264

They are our clients!

265

(sorry)

266
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,684
This is what I came up with

267
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:12,224
Kono Junki-san is JO1's main vocal

268
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,759
And he loves to sing

269
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,529
- So I made it a mic
- Ah, that's a mic?

270
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,930
What did you write on the bottom left?

271
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,199
It writes 'THIS ONE', telling them to make this

272
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,671
'THIS ONE' as in 'this one please'?

273
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,273
We can see his usual English skills too

It does

It feels like the main character

That's true

302

JOCHUM is cute too

333

A short one may be best

334
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,680
That's true, generally I think a simple one is good

335
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,217
At a glance, it's recognisable

336
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,352

For the words, we want to include JO1

338

They are kids aiming for their dreams

342
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,372
Then we should include 'DREAM'

343
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,773
It feels like that

344
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,174
But it'll become too long

345
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,776
Then isn't it JODREAM?

346
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,512
