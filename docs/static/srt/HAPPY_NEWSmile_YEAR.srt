Where the dart hits...

41
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:39,582
The New Year's cards will
be sent to 40,000 people,

42
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,286

So we still don't know
who it will be sent to, right?

Yes, it will be sent to people
in that prefecture.

46
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,135
So 11 of us will throw a dart,

47
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:52,346

to 11 prefectures.

There are a limited number of New Year's cards,

not everyone can receive this.

54

- Wow!

185
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:20,221
[Fukuoka]

186
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:22,308
He's experienced in darts.

187
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,010
We did a good job.

188
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,245
- Right.
- Thank you very much.

189
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,355
- Sho-kun, aim here.
- Sho-kun, please hit it in my stead.

190
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:30,183
By the way, which one is Okinawa?

191
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,183
Kokusai-dori is around here.

192
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:36,089
- Aim for that.
- Go, go, go.

193
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,557
Sho-kun, where is Shuri Castle?

194
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,493
That's enough!

195
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,133
- Where's Churaumi Aquarium?
- Churaumi Aquarium is...

196
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,163
That's enough!

197
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:47,915
- You know it so well.
- As expected.

198
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,336
- Let's do it.
- Nice.

199
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,104
Sho-kun seems used to throwing darts.

200
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,011
- That's close.
- This is difficult.

201
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,576
Your aim is good.

202
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,112
Oh so close!

203
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,003
This is...

204
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:13,789
well, it's somewhere in Okinawa.

205
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,296
[Okinawa]

206
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,230
All right, thank you everyone!

207
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,134
Thank you!

208
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:30,976
We'll be sending an original New Year's card to 40,000 people,

209
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,074
so please look forward to it!

210
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:38,718
Right, and do you remember the serial number
I mentioned earlier?

211
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:44,786
In January, we will have a lottery
for the serial numbers on the card.

212
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:52,582
Please look forward to it.
The details are on the homepage.

213
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:57,223
Please wait with your serial numbers on hand.

214
00:08:57,223 --> 00:09:00,506
So how was playing darts, everyone?

215
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,544
Harder than expected.

216
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,924
Did you go to the place you wanted?

217
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,359
- Yes.
- The place you wanted to get.

218
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:09,716
About half of us, right?

219
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,485
About 3. I think Okinawa is the most difficult.

220
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,126
Okinawa is the odd one out.

221
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:15,503
It was so hard.

222
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:19,526
But we got many places that
we've never been to, so I'm happy.

223
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:25,899
It's 40,000 people, so please look forward
to how it'll be delivered.

224
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,078
With that, thank you very much for today.

225
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,018
That was JO1!

226
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,906
Bye bye~

227
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,740
See you!
