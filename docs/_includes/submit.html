    Are you a JAM translator who would like to contribute subtitles?<br>
    We would love to add to our list of available subtitles, to allow JO1's charms to reach more international JAMs!

    Since the purpose of this site is to provide subs while contributing to official view counts without reuploading, we only plan to include videos from official accounts.<br><br>

    We welcome subs of:<br><br>

    • Videos from JO1 Official YouTube channel (<b>excluding</b> YouTube shorts as they are not supported for embedding)<br>
    • Other official YouTube videos featuring JO1 (i.e KitKat etc.) - However, please ensure that embed is enabled by the uploader (click 'share' on the video page & check that the 'embed' option is there in the popup)<br><br>

    From JO1's Official YouTube channel, you may consider subbing:<br><br>

    • PROCESS JO1 (EP. 23 ~ 27)<br>
    • ECC presents JO1<br>
    • Livestream videos<br>
    • Other old videos from 2020 (most are unsubbed)<br><br>

    However, feel free to submit subs even of videos that do have official subs (since the quality is questionable at times), as it can be provided as an extra option to JAMs.

    • Do double-check with the videos we currently have on this site to prevent overlap/double work.<br><br>
    • An admin may QC your subtitles to ensure accuracy, we hope you understand! :)<br><br>
    • Due to possible varying FPS timecode of srt files, the timing of the subs on the site may be off by a few ms (it would still match up to the audio, but if you timed it to match the JP hardsubs on the video, it may not match exactly)
