    Are you a JAM translator who would like to contribute subtitles?<br>
    We would love to add to our list of available subtitles, to allow JO1's charms to reach more international JAMs!

    DM <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveforJAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArchiveForJAM</a> with the following: <br><br>
    • Your subtitle file (.srt format)<br>
    • The url to the original YouTube video (only videos from official accounts, and note that YouTube Shorts are not supported)<br>
    • The name you would like us to specify in the credits (+ the link to your page/site if it's different from the account you are DM-ing from)<br><br>

    Note that an admin may QC your subtitles to ensure accuracy, we hope you understand! :)

  <p style='padding: 1rem; font-size: 1rem; width: 40vw;  min-width: 330px; text-align: left;'>
    Most of their older videos from 2020 currently do not have official subs, and since they're pretty old we doubt official subs will be added.<br>
    Other videos include but are not limited to:<br><br>
    • OffCamJO1 series<br>
    • PROCESS JO1 (EP. 23 ~ 27)<br>
    • ECC presents JO1<br>
    • Livestream videos<br><br>

    Do double-check with the videos we currently have on this site, as we can only display one subtitle set.<br><br>
    However, feel free to submit subs of videos that do have official subs (since the quality is questionable at times), as it can be provided as an extra option to JAMs.<br><br>
